        "Message": "I don't tend to eat at hotels so unfortunately only have a couple to share.\n\nFirst is my personal experience in Hakone - we stayed at Hakone Yutowa (https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZcSYiNQouMb1q9wV8) last March and liked it so much that we're going back next month for our second trip.  When we booked, my husband included a message saying that I have Celiac and need to eat gluten-free.  We'd seen a few comments about it online and thought it would be fine.  They responded back saying they won't make special food for me, but the breakfast and dinner buffets have allergens marked.  When we arrived, on our first night, they checked with us when we got to dinner and confirmed my gluten-free needs, then later a server came to our table to ask what \"main dish\" we wanted for our dinners and let me know that one of them could be made with no sauce and would be gluten-free.  They also brought me a special plate of roast beef, that I assume was different from the roast beef at the buffet somehow but they didn't explain it, haha.  At breakfast, they again confirmed my GF-ness as we checked in and I received a bowl of soup with tofu and veggies that my husband didn't get when he joined me a bit later, so I think that may have been special for me as well.  Overall, I had a lovely time at the hotel and am excited to go back.  The buffets were both really nice, with a good amount of options, and honestly the gelato at dinner was exquisite.\n\nFor Tokyo, I've heard that Gluten-Free T's (a very popular 100% gluten-free restaurant) opened a second location that is also 100% GF and does different food from the original location that is located in the APA Hotel Ueno Hirokoji (https://maps.app.goo.gl/TsYTzn8ATybqQut46).  So if you want very convenient access to that restaurant, that hotel is an option though I haven't stayed there myself yet.",

Currently exploring Kyoto and went to a place I haven't seen recommended on here after searching, but I had a great time. \n\nMENBAKA FIRE RAMEN: They were very good with my dietary requirements, modifying everything to be gluten free. They used gluten free soy sauce to make ramen, gyoza and fried rice for me (and also making sure it was all vegetarian). The restaurant is an \"experience\", so having my food served before or after would've left me feeling left out. They carefully cooked mine separately but made sure I got my food with everyone else and got the same experience. Highly recommend.\n\nAddress: 757-2 Minamiiseyacho, Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto, 602-8153, Japan\n\n#glutenfree #ramen #gyoza #vegetarian #vegan #kyoto",

    "Title": "Summary from our 8 day trip to Tokyo with my 9 year old coeliac son \n\nWe extensively used 711 for breakfasts and lunches were possible as it was cost effective and had some go to GF options for him. The kids loved the 711 smoothie cups you put in the machine and must have had a dozen or more each on the trip. \n\nSome places we really struggled to find proper lunches for him and he had to resort to just the snacks we packed for the day. Even had to resort to McDonalds French fries a couple of times. \n\nWe initially started off trying to use local lunch options but just became too hard as almost all would read the travel card and then politely state they couldn't help. \n\nWhere we had success was \n- GF T's Kitchen: had lunch twice at Ueno and dinner once at Roppongi\n- Gonpachi in Asakusa for a wonderful dinner overlooking the river and Sky Tree\n- Rice Hack: for a late lunch pizza that he loved\n- Kuroboshi Sweets: churros shop in Asakusa\n- Yakiniku Toraji: Korean BBQ at Disneyland Gateway Mall\n- Over Macrons: a tiny street vendor in Shibuya that just does amazing GF Macrons that I stumbled across \n- Black Eggs at the Hakone ropeway \n\nWe also found that going to large food courts (Sky Tree mall, opposite Tokyo Station etc) provided some dinner options like Mexican which could be made GF\n\nDisneyland and Disney Sea was saved by the spreadsheet table some on this group had made as it greatly helped knowing where to go. To be fair the food options are average and limited for a Coeliac and so he survived on fries, popcorn and ice cream and made sure he had big breakfasts beforehand. The hotels also weren't that good (seemed mostly very expensive buffets) and so ate at the Gateway Mall or 711. \n\nWhat surprised me by Disney is once you can get hold of a supervisor at each of the eating places they have a great app on an iPad where you select your allergies and it then shows what is left that you can have. Just not sure why they don't make this same app available to the public. And I would avoid the turkey legs, not because they are not safe. Just because they are tough and very bland. \n\nHope this helps overs with younger children when travelling to Tokyo.",

They also had a GF breakfast pastry in the case on the day I visited.\n\nGeneral location: The cafe is located in the same building as APA Hotel Yokohama Bay Tower.

So Im worried how difficult it will be finding GF and Low/no sugar. I have to be careful bc too much rice/carbs mess with my sugar.\n\n I am bringing almond butter, protein powder and some protein bars I can eat. \nShe said there's tons of eggs, fresh fruits/veggies. \nI ordered a GF card and have my diabetic identification. I've downloaded the apps.\n\nAny other tips/tricks? Things to avoid. Things to absolutely have. \n\nWe're going to Both Disneys, to See Mt Fuji, and as many amazing cultural experiences as we can fit it. \nIt's my first time overseas from the US. So I'm trying to figure out all the things.",

There is a place in Tokyo called Ricehack that has fabulous gf pizza and breads. Also LaBoheme has gf pasta. Various locations in Tokyo and I think Yokohama. M’s Table in Yokohama has a lot of gf options. We also love sushiro and yakiniku. You can find stuff at both places without sauce. Disney is a little tough. I think there is a curry there she can eat. They allow you to bring food in so she always brings a couple sandwiches when we go. Commissary has gf bread in the freezer section.  Hope you have a wonderful visit!",

    "Title": "We just came back from our trip to Japan. Sticking to a gluten free diet in Japan was a challenge for me, but here are some tips I would like to share hoping Iit helps you on planning your trip.\nBreakfast: Unless you have it booked with your hotel, it was a bit hard to find GF food early in the morning; we wanted a more authentic experience so we decided not to have breakfast at the hotels which was quite of a challenge since must restaurants either open after 11:00 am or don’t sell gluten free food, what we ended up doing was going to 7/11 or any convenience store and have yogurt, cheese sticks and sometimes onigri. Having raw fish for breakfast wears thin after a few days \nFor lunches and dinner, we showed the waiters an allergy card, most of the time it worked, they would either suggest having our meals with salt or have some white vinegar but some others were not accommodating so don’t feel afraid of walking out of a restaurant if they can’t accommodate you (although very polite, we were kicked out of a restaurant cause they couldn’t provide me with GF food) \nGoogle translate was a good tool but sometimes due to the way the packages were done, I couldn’t get google to work. Lawson natural was a great find (almost at the end of our trip) and found the amazing but expensive bread that I have in the picture.\nI think if I would do this trip again, I probably try to find the natural store early and or bring snacks from home.",

    "Title": "WAITING IN VAIN at #tokyostation and craving for #dessert ❓Many have repeatedly mentioned #soranoiro but it's not really a place where you can stay a little longer if you have a bus or bullet train (#skinkansen) to wait for. \n\nEasiest option is to find a #Starbucks because I've been noticing that they have been keeping at least one wheat-free (possible cross-contamination due to same cake display) option each season. Many talked about the chocolate and matcha rice flour roll cake and cupcake, which they changed to peach, which they now changed to banana. I've enjoyed all of them 😋 \n\nBut if you have Google Maps, within 3-8 MINUTES, mostly via Marunouchi Exit, so many GF options abound. They're not GF advertised, but I usually have meetings at Tokyo Station, so I've learned to seek and find. \n\n● I loooove the cream-filled rusks made of almond flour at #PecheMignon Artisan de Saveur and chef says it is wheat-free (with a GF card, they can easily identify other allergens). \n\n● The meringue macaron from #PierreHerme satisfies post-meal cravings. \n\n● The geisha caramel pudding and the top tier coffee from #gesharycoffee comes with a good view at the top floor. \n\n● #Rosebakery at the Comme de Garcons boutique (has salad and desserts!) comes with Tokyo-only fashion options. \n\nI'm mobile now so can't locate and pin individually but basically all are within 3-8 minutes walk from Tokyo Station. Pin below if you can. 🥰 \n\nHappy (Not) Waiting in Vain! 🤭 \n\nIf you care for more pics, details and summary, find them in stories and location-grouped (per train station coming up) highlights here \nhttps://www.instagram.com/glutenfreejapandelivery?igsh=MTI3M2o3Z29za3M2dw==",

        "Message": "Lee Marshall Many people have written about this in the past. 😊 Unfortunately, coeliac and gluten intolerance are mostly unknown to Japan. My two doctors, 7 years ago (high-demand ones😏), can't endorse me to any coeliac or gluten intolerance test because there's none. According to them, it's not an inherent Japanese disease. This is not of \"national concern,\" so there's no regulating body and people are undereducated about it. Some Japanese have wheat allergy though, hence health dept education available and a market for wheat free. 😊 Hence, many Japan residents have come up with gluten-free cards itemizing each coeliac allergen (and potential hidden gluten) because \"gluten-free,\" even those who market as such, may not even be GF-certified. 😊 That's why the group exists, I think. It's undeniably a challenge, so everyone exchanges info, and reads allergens on packages for others, because Japanese GF-certified is technically non-existent in Japan. 😏 Being part of this community is possibly the best way to get around, working around available options. We all have different sensitivities and tolerance (and desperation 😂) levels, I believe 😊 \n\nIf anything, Rose Bakery markets some products as gluten-free. 😏\nIf you need GF cards and info about basic info/reality of \"GF state\" in Japan, you can find them here:  https://www.instagram.com/glutenfreejapandelivery?igsh=MTI3M2o3Z29za3M2dw==",

You can order the lunch menu, which consists of fish or meat (you can replace this one with a vegetarian option), rice, salad. Besides, you get some tomatoes, pumpkin, radish and cucumber. Today I had chicken meatballs there. Is 3ish/5 star, but since there aren’t so many GF options, I decided to post about it. An old, friendly couple is serving you. She speaks English and knows what gluten is. I waited less than 10 minutes. The menu is 1100yen. I ordered separately one more portion of chicken meatballs since the portion was small for me, but they were good. \n\nFYI: I'm not celiac, so I didn't ask any additional questions after I made sure they didn't use ingredients with gluten. Check for yourself please.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/yKEdAPmvy4bnMrTk9?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy",

    "Title": "This was mentioned last year, but without an address or website. \n\nMarugoto Vegan\n\nThere’s a small #vegan, GF eatery by the riverside in #asakusa. It’s called #marugotovegan. \n\nMy husband and I enjoyed a lovely, casual early dinner there yesterday (they close at 6PM). We both had salad and the fried pea and fava bean “meat.” He had a beer and I had the sake. \n\nI was a strict vegetarian for several years, so I love places like this, but I will say that it has that “healthy food” taste, which I know not everyone loves. Good flavor, good texture if you’re used to vegan food. And my meat-eating husband said he was impressed!\n\nAll food is GF. Not all drinks are. All menu items are vegan and free of garlic, onion, leeks. \n\nWebsite (with full menu): https://dining.marugotovegan.com/menu/\n\nAddress:\n1 Chome-3-13 Hanakawado, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0033, Japan\n\nGoogle maps link below 👇",

    "Title": "SURVIVAL HACK: Find a local #supermarket usually a few meters away from the train station. As much as I love Seijo Isshi, it's way pricier than regular supermarkets. The ones directly connected to the train stations are usually pricer because they have to pay the rent, except for #TokyuSupermarket found in Tokyu Train Stations. THERE ARE TREASURES UNTOLD at night, nearing the closing time. If you're tired from the day and failed to get a good meal, you can actually easily whip up a JAPANESE SPECIALTY in your AirBnB. This #DIYrecipe is about 500 yen, but so packed with healthy, filling protein. \n\nThis one is a karashi #mentaiko or spicy pollack cod roe on sale for about 399 YEN for three slabs. Get those packs of rice (on the shelves for about 450 yen for 5 trays). Buy a tray of eggs and boil them. If there's a dollar store (Daiso, Can Do, Seria), there are soft boiled egg containers to make one in the microwave in 1.40 seconds (precise because this is what it says in the label, and what I do on lazy days). Try natto with these. Stinky but very good for the gut, which we intolerants want. No other flavoring needed, but I personally like sesame seeds and sesame oil drizzled on top. MENTAIKO is rich in B12 good for the nerves and energy replenishment for long days. Also rich in Omega 3 which has a long list of benefits. \"Eases inflammation\" may be the most useful for us. If mentaiko is not your thing, sashimi slices on sale abound at night, which I could have for dinner and brunch (with a fridge). \n\nAnd the other pic, well, FOR A BALANCED DIET 😂 I know sugar ain't on the healthy list but sweet tooth calling. These ones are grocery/supermarket brands below. I looooove the mochi in caramel ice cream (the one in a maroon cup; the matcha version is also good). I hardly see them in convenience stores (or maybe sporadically stocked) and if they have one, it's usually x 2.5 the price of those in supermarkets. These range from 99 yen to 150 yen for the cream-based stuff, and 250 for the kurumi (walnut mochi). Not all mochis are created equal, and this one's my favorite (almost like the specialty of Okayama Prefecture).❤️ The law now mandates clear markings for ALLERGENS so the cream-based stuff clearly shows these. The handmade mochi packaging still needs to catch up with the labelling. I mainly scanned the ingredients (CLEAR!) and only skimmed through cross-contamination, since I hardly react to it and was soooo famished, so double check. \n\nIf you want to see the back labels, it's in Insta Stories, which will be later clearly grouped with GF Grocery Highlights. If the last thing you want though, is think of your food during a packed itinerary, there's always an option for gluten-free delivery. 😉 \n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/glutenfreejapandelivery?igsh=MTI3M2o3Z29za3M2dw==",

I have found a few GF Gems - but found this Natural Supermarket “**Bio-Ral**” which has an allergy-free section & so many GF goodies!! Has a lot of Vegan options too & even one section has nut-free, dairy-free, wheat-free, etc etc etc! ☺️\n\n#kanazawa\n\nItalian Resturant** Carlo Centro**! They didn't have GF Pasta or Pizza BUT they had multiple items labeled gluten-free on the English Menu.  I had messaged them on Instagram before going & they sent me images of the English menu with each option I could have and showed the GF label.  Amazing Service - the GF options are on the Dinner menu BUT we went at Lunch and they allowed me to order off the dinner menu.  I had 2 amazing appetizers. \n\n https://g.co/kgs/tx7Gs6N\n\n#tokyo\n\n**Gluten Free T's** - tried the new location! A lot more spacious than the original which we visited last year but the food was just as good :) Fried Chicken & Dumplings!\n\n[https://g.co/kgs/Jzjb6aH](https://g.co/kgs/Jzjb6aH)\n\n**Coco Curry**! I had the Allergy Free Curry in Nishi-Shinjuku \n\n#takayama\n\nIt has been mentioned here **Royal Nan House Takayama.**  I had a butter Chicken - wasn't the best curry I've ever had but felt safe & there were a few GF Curry options - chef spoke good english & understood GF. *****naan in the photo is not mine hahah",

    "Title": "PSA: Those planning their weekend grocery.😂CASE IN POINT: Seijo Ishii vs. Gyomu Supermarket #grocery #shopping \n\nI loooove #seijoishii  and I have it at my home station, so one long day at work always brings me there. I can read the allergens so the cheese and everything for charcuterie always get me. And I have a sweet tooth, so double whammy. 😅 But when I want to have more bang for my buck, I walk a little farther from the station and go to a #GyomuSupermarket \n\nThese churros from Seijo are my kryptonite. The thing is, I can finish it in 2-3 days with restraint 😅. It costs 699 YEN. At Gyomu, the choco covered dates and nuts cost 298 YEN and the coconut crispy roll (like wafer/langue de chat creamy feels) costs 278 YEN. Those from Gyomu can possibly (with restraint 😂) last me 7 DAYS. And this is just one of the 30 something things I bought from Gyomu (frozen brussel sprouts and meats included 😂)\n\nI feel sad for those who have a hard time finding food in Japan, mainly because of the general lack of knowledge of Japan of gluten, and the intimidating kanji. But for those of us who've lived our pre-glutenfree and gluten free life in Japan for years, Japan can honestly be affordable and enjoyable. \n\nI have tooo many photos of my grocery hunts from Gyomu in my stories if you care to see it  Happy Weekend shopping! 🥰\nhttps://www.instagram.com/glutenfreejapandelivery?igsh=MTI3M2o3Z29za3M2dw==",

Then there are Protein bars in some other aisle. And they always carry the GF breads, and for some reason even the very small branch at the station in my area, has extensive GF stuff with the prep meals. Gf curry, pancake mix, flours. There are GF pastas but usually not with grouped with the \"stick pasta\" but with the pasta sauces because usually they come in different form. My favorite is the Salted Caramel churros, though. 😋 Of course a lot of cheese, meats, dairy, drinks that are naturally GF, but wih no labels. I've never gone empty-handed after a trip at any seijo ishii. 😅 But I personally find more stuff from Aeon (also Peacock and Max Value run by Aeon) and Bio-ral definitely. May I ask which seijo ishii branch you're planning to go? 😅 Once upon a time, when GF was scarce, it was my version for a Friday night bar-hopping. 😂",

Starting with a base of salad greens, I mixed that with a can of salmon. Then I had a hard boiled egg for additional protein. Sometimes I buy a pack of rice to go with this but I already had rice for breakfast so I didn’t want anymore. Then a bag of frozen mangoes for dessert. By the time I finished eating the mangoes had softened enough that it was like mango ice cream 😋. Definitely check out the frozen fruit. I didn’t check all the labels, but it should just be pure fruit. There isn’t that much in the bag so it’s easy to eat all of it at once. ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼",

Habla inglés y entiende perfectamente el problema del gluten. \nTiene un horario muy reducido, de 11.30 a 15.00, y al ser sólo él, puede haber cola y tener que esperar ya que el sitio es pequeño, pero está delicioso.

    "Title": "Narita is notoriously bad for options, but I had about 8-9 hours there recently before a long haul flight and found some things, just thought I'd share to add some info (it's possible these places are newish, I'm not too sure, but didn't see them in any previous posts)\n\n1. Jai Thai Narita - in the food court Terminal 1, absolutely incredible curry!! The best Thai curry I've had in Japan. Tastes just like in Thailand. They have allergy information but they only had wheat listed on items with flour (not on dishes that likely contain soy sauce) so I opted for curry just to be safe. You order through a machine. \n\n(They also have a salad place there that has options too and looked good)\n\n2. Snacks from The American Pharmacy - not amazing but at least there were a few things to choose from. \n\n3. They do have the Doraemon Tokyo banana but I could only find them in one shop, near the check in counters on the side with the currency exchange. I didn't get a photo.\n\nAlso just adding that Ethiopian airlines was absolutely awful from Japan - Korea and also from Korea. They served me bread, wheat crackers, dressing with wheat in it (Korean packaging but I can read Korean and knew it wasn't safe.) Definitely pack food despite requesting the gluten free meal if you fly with them (from other countries it was fine)",

The highlighted items in the dinner menu were not gluten free. Honestly the private onsens and the experience staying at the Ryokan were absolutely delightful, including the very convenient location, I wouldn't mind going back. \nThere's so much food so if you are going with other people who are willing to share some of their portion of food items you can have, you won't be hungry.  Lastly I think they also include items made with glutinous rice as not gluten free. \n#arashiyama #onsenryokan \n....,..........,...........................\nI booked a ryokan, and they came back with this:  Does it mean they can't accommodate wheat allergies?  \n\"FOOD ALLERGIES:\nIf you have any food allergies, please inform us of the specific item(s) and number of people.\n*Available up to 4 days before arrival. Only removal of the actual foodstuff. We cannot accommodate \"removal of ingredients\", \"wheat/soy/nut/fish allergies\", \"likes/dislikes\", \"vegetarian/vegan diets\" or \"religious diets\".",

Signage out the front advertises gluten free and the man inside showed me what was gf. \n\nMostly bagels and bread from what i could tell, but the bagels were so soft! Glad i bought a couple of them. \n\nI didn’t ask about cross contamination when baking and they do sell non-gf goods, however i’m coeliac and didn’t have any reaction 🤗\n\n21 Mibunishidoinouchicho, Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto, 604-8847, Japan\n\n〒604-8847 京都府京都市中京区壬生西土居ノ内町21\n\n#kyoto #bakery #bagel #bread",

It advertises as 100% gluten free - I don't know whether the ice cream they use in some of the parfaits etc would have mizuame, but certainly everything home-made in store is rice-based.

I'll pack some nuts and protein bars, but still feeling a bit anxious about it.\n\nI have brain fog to the max, does anyone have photos of readily available gluten free low carb products that I could likely get at a konbini?

It did help that my mother in law is Japanese and we spent some time with her family who was super helpful when buying/cooking me food 🥹🥹 \nHowever it still was a tad difficult having to go out of the way to eat rather than just walking into the first place you see. \nPlaces visited were Hiroshima, Osaka, Miyajima island, Kyoto and Tokyo. We visited family out near Mt Fuji, only reason I found it easy there was because we had family to cook for us and communicate easier with restaurants. \nEasiest places by far was Tokyo and I found Osaka the hardest. \n\nThe gf food map and Google translate were my best friends when my MIL wasn’t around. Super convenient able to use to translate ingredients lists. I also learnt the Japanese word for wheat\n 小麦  when looking at the ingredients list. \nHowever it’s nearly impossible to look out for barley and rye so I didn’t even bother. I went with my gut instinct on some things eg didn’t eat sauces. \nI took my own soy sauce which came in handy and I bought little sachets of kewpie in Japan to carry to put on salads! \n\nThis was my first time back in Japan since being diagnosed and I was very scared I would be eating rice everyday ( not a bad thing but I love Japanese food haha ). Since I’ll be going back often as my husband has family in Japan it’s nice knowing I can comfortably eat there 😋 \n\nAll photos have the locations of the places I knew 😁\n\n#japan #glutenfree #tokyo #osaka #hiroshima #kyoto #ramen #mtfuji #tips #miyajima #restaurants",

    "Title": "Hi everybody,\nNow it’s my turn to give a contribution to this group that has been very useful to plan my trip to Japan. I booked all dinners in advance and also some lunches. \nHere are the restaurant we personally tried:\n\n#TOKYO\n- Gluten Free T’s Kitchen Ueno-hirokoji: very very friendly staff but service a bit slow and not well organized. Almoust everything is fried (also things that shouldn’t) so the dinner was a bit heavy, but overall I would suggest it at least for the possibility to eat in a completely safe place.\n\n- Gonpachi Asakusa: very friendly service and good choice of dishes thanks to the gluten-free separate menu. Not so “typical”, many tourists, but overall it’s ok to try some japanese specialties. \n\n- Heijōen (Asakusa): restaurant yakiniku style. We showed the gluten-free card and they seemed to understand, at least they understood that the meat should be served without sauces. We had our rice and meat to cook by ourselves, since the meat was plain we didn’t have any problem. \n\n- Sushi Morinari: an excellent service in this (quite pricey) sushi omakase. The staff knew about gluten and didn’t use any sauce in the preparation of the nigiri. They also had gluten free sauce. It’s better to book in advance indicating in the reservation that the lunch/dinner should be gluten free so that they are prepared. \n\n- Teppan Baby (Shinjuku): good okonomyaki, very friendly staff and nice place. They are prepared about gluten, the only things to consider is that all stuffs are cooked on the same place to it’s not suggested for people with a strong allergy. \n\n#KANAZAWA\n- Love for all: staff very friendly and good choice on the menu. Not so memorable but I would suggest it as a very safe place. \n\n- Kourin Sushi: since on monday almost everything was closed, we chose this place with very good reviews. Sushi is very good, fresh and also cheap but they needed to be told in advance that one person was gluten intolerant. So they kindly said that sushi could’t be served since it contained gluten, but the menu offers some nice alternatives such as a tuna fillet that was very good and it was served with plain white rice. \n\n#TAKAYAMA \n- Aji-no-Yohei: good Hida beef, not specifically gluten-free. It offers different menus with meat, rice, vegetables, miso soup. If you just eat the meat and the rice it’is safe for sure, maybe it’s better to avoid the vegetables (that are topped with a sauce) and the miso soup. \n\n#KYOTO\n- Gion Soy milk ramen: we came here twice. 4/5 ramen choices and some appetizers. Ramen was good, someone may not appreciate the soy milk taste but I liked it. \n\n- Choice: good choice of dishes, even a (small) pizza. Nice and quiet atmosphere.\n\n- Masaemon (link Maps: https://maps.google.com/?q=Giappone,%20%E3%80%92605-0826%20Kyoto,%20Higashiyama%20Ward,%20Masuyacho,%20349-21%20%E3%82%B8%E3%83%93%E3%82%A8%E3%83%BB%E6%B4%BB%E5%B7%9D%E9%AD%9A%E6%96%99%E7%90%86%E3%83%BB%E5%8D%81%E5%89%B2%E6%89%8B%E6%89%93%E3%81%A1%E8%95%8E%E9%BA%A6%E5%87%A6%20%E3%80%8C%E6%94%BF%E5%8F%B3%E8%A1%9B%E9%96%80%E3%80%8D(MASAEMON)&ftid=0x600109a72b6b2469:0xa0a247525adfb00f&entry=gps&lucs=,94224825,94227247,94227248,47071704,47069508,94218641,94203019,47084304,94208458,94208447&g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy): our best culinary experience in Japan. The chef speaks only Japanese but the communication is made possible thanks to a translator that he uses with voice transcription. He prepares gluten free 100% buckwheat  soba noodles that can be served with different kinds of meat/ fish plates. Booked in advance online. \n\n- Steak Misono: very expensive and booked in advance to treat ourselves with a culinary experience to taste Kobe beef. Very recommended, they understand about gluten.\n\n- Sugarhill: good choice of western and asian dishes, their best is chicken teryiaki.\n\n#NARA\n- Big mountain cafe & farm: nice place, good choice of dishes, we tried a good hamburger. \n\n#HIROSHIMA\n- More Than: western style place with a dedicated gluten free menu (mainly contaning meat/fish/salads).\n\n#MIYAJIMA\n- Miyajima Base: chicken curry was not avaiable so we took chicken bites with rice. A bit heavy but it remains a good alternative on the island to eat something safe. \n\nRegarding the accomodations: \n\nTOKYO\n- Asakusa Tobu Hotel: at the breakfast all the allergens are clearly indicated. No specific gluten free dishes, the choice is among eggs, salad, fruit, rice. \n\nKANAZAWA\n- Tokyu Stay Kanazawa: same as the previous hotel, but with a smaller choice of dishes at breakfast. I wouldn’t recommend it.\n\nTAKAYAMA\n- Oyado Koto No Yume (Ryokan): they know about gluten and they even serve a gluten free version of their breakfast with gluten free bread (made with rice flour)\n\nKYOTO\n- Hotel Alza: breakfast is served in the room, they know about gluten so they can serve a gluten free breakfast. They don’t add things like gluten free bread, they simply remove the food with gluten from the traditional breakfast. \n\nMIYAJIMA\n- Miyajima Seaside hotel: same as above, they know the problem and the breakfast is served removing the ingredients with gluten. \n\nHope this can be useful :)",

If I'm remembering correctly, their breakfast buffet was very expensive (the most expensive of all our hotels during our 24 day stay in Japan), and I did not see any allergen markings. It was not that good-tasting, either.  Really nice hotel, though!  Riiiiight down the street from their bus, which you can buy the tourist pass for in the hotel hobby. Saved us a ton of money. So easy to hop on and off the special bus line for tourist spots once you get the hang of it...😅\n\nHere's the map from another user that helped me the most on my trip: https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=35.00351730692734%2C135.7755862755366&z=17&fbclid=IwAR2WsWDoWKhm_uHwyxOwMjRqxw2XSS_8ljkqMIWk4AwgDgunNsmhorXQNbM&mid=1iwutbbadlGniNmCDVuBz_2E5BVlyb5s\n\nKEY: Red are dedicated gluten-free or extremely accommodating. Blue means I've verified through either comments in this page or the restaurant websites/reviews that the restaurants have GF options or can accommodate when asked/phone ahead/allergy card.

I emailed on their website to book the day before. They also are a hotel so would be a good option if you need somewhere to stay I would guess the cost is quite high as it was rather modern. \n#gora #hakone\n\n1320-179 Gora, Hakone, Ashigarashimo District, Kanagawa 250-0408, Japan",

Let me know if you spot them!\n\nEDIT:  I don't mean to mollycoddle, or deprive you of your chance to improve your Japanese, but the english directions leave a little to be desired so Just a little tweaking to make the instructions even easier to follow!

I've added ginger as a suggestion.\n\nDELICIOUS WAY TO ENJOY SOMEN \n\nONE BAG (APPROX. 2 SERVINGS)\n\nCooking Instructions\n1. Before cooking the noodles, prepare your dipping sauce (tsuyu), toppings (yakumi), and bowls. Bring 2 liters of water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Gradually add the somen noodles, stirring gently to prevent them from sticking together. Cook for 3 minutes.\n1. Quickly transfer the noodles to a colander and rinse thoroughly under cold running water. Gently rub the noodles together to remove excess starch. Drain well.\n1. Serve the noodles in your prepared dipping sauce (tsuyu). Add your favorite toppings, such as grated ginger (shoga), wasabi, green onions, or other ingredients of your choice.\n1. Besides cold somen, you can also enjoy them in hot soup, stir-fried, or as a salad.\n\n#japan #udon #somen",

I visited Sapporo, stayed in Asahedake Onsen to do hiking and visited Furano.\n\nSapporo:\nFuku Noki: rice noodles, tomato based ramen which was different but nice and a really lovey owner.\nRing Ring: gluten free baked goods, really yummy\nCauldra: definitely visit this place, everything was gluten free on the menu, I had my first pain au chocolate in many years, and chicken and waffles and a croque monsieur!\nCologne Annex: teppanyaki, chef was so lovely and very accommodating of coeliac. I watched him cook everything and he checked with me multiple times about different ingredients. I did not have any symptoms and the food was SO good- we had steak and seafood\nIkanari Steak: a little izakaya, understanding of gluten free using allergy card, yummy steak\n\nAsahedake:\nWe stayed at Bear Monte hotel for 3 days as a base to do walking. They knew I was gluten free and as breakfast and dinner were included they made sure I had something safe to eat. There was additional buffet style items and everything labelled with allergens. I have not had any symptoms so labels hopefully accurate. Would recommend for anyone looking to stay in Daizetsuzan National Park for hiking \n\nFurano:\nSora no kujira: we happened upon this place while stopping through Furano briefly. Everything gluten free and made of rice flour. I bought a muffin, brownies and a slice of pizza and all was very good. No English menu though (apart from the signs saying everything is rice flour) so use your google translate lens!\n\nNames of services are what they come up as on google maps. \n\nHopefully this helps someone heading to Sapporo! For reference I am a fairly sensitive coeliac. I used the allergy cards from this group!\n\n#sapporo #furano #asahedake #hokkaido",

Eat in or take out\n\nFood: gluten free & vegan Japanese curry, taco salad, crepes, muffins, cookies, parfaits, mont blanc, and gateau\n\nPrice: 1,300¥ for gf/v curry, 420¥ for a gf/v muffin, 610¥ for a 6 pack of gf/v cookies, 1,500¥ for a gf/v parfait. \n\nSafety: I explained I have an allergy to wheat, not gluten, and I heard her explaining to the kitchen that it was a wheat allergy and that was why all the gluten free. That being said I struggled with our discussion on whether or not the oatmeal was certified gf. Since I have gotten hives from eating non-gf oatmeal in the past, I steered clear of the bottom half of my gf/v fruits parfait and didn't get any oatmeal cookies. The rest of the gf goods appears to use rice/almond flour.\n\nTaste: curry and top half of parfait were excellent, excited bear cookies are \"meh\" but beggars can't be choosers.

Everywhere else, I allotted enough time if we had to wait, had a backup plan in the area, etc.  \n\nNow, if someone from this group recommended we make reservations, I definitely took that into consideration. I did call one place to make reservations (also in Takayama), but turns out that restaurant changed to not serving foreigners during lunch, so I didn't eat there. (Already had reservations for dinner with the first place I mentioned.)\n\nDid that make sense...? 🤔😅",

And I emailed the place to ask if I was able to eat it, I explained everything about gluten and I got a respond in English where she explained that she had contacted the kitchen and they had double checked all the ingredients and that the mochi was safe for me to eat (mochi, soybean powder and syrup). The savory dish on the menu unfortunately contains soy sauce so I wasn't able to try that but my partner was, apparently it was very tasty (last picture). The place itself is an experience, you get a small guided tour of the house and garden, it belonged to a famous artist. I requested a table with a view and a view I got, so amazing. They have different kinds of tea also that I was able to order. I recommend booking a table online. \nThe place is called Rokujuan, it's in Kyoto. I'll link to their website in the comment section.",

My son, who knows some Japanese and helping me navigate and order food, is now in a language camp all day. So I wandered around looking at the signs and pictures of food seeing mostly breaded or sauced items. I finally ran into a little shop with strawberry smoothies. It was about the best smoothie I have ever had. They also have strawberry beer mixed with Carlsberg beer which says it does not contain wheat on their website.  On my way back to the train station I found sweet potato cakes at a small shop across from the station entrance and was able to use Google translate to find out they had no flour or wheat. I’ve had my fill of sweet today but both items were delicious! I am posting pictures of the shop/items - sorry, I don’t have addresses.",

They post the week’s offerings and allergy/dietary restrictions (dairy, nuts, refined sugar). You will need to use a translation service for the breakdowns as everything is in Japanese.\n\nThis place is *NEW* so the name of the place won’t show up unless you can write in Japanese using a Japanese keyboard. I included the Google maps link because we are an English-speaking group.\n\nFrom the description in Google Maps:\n\nGluten-free sweets made with natural ingredients that are not harmful to the body\n\nEach item is carefully handmade. No butter or white sugar used. Basically, we use natural and organic materials as much as possible.\n\nOur customers feel that they don't feel sick to their stomachs after eating.\n\nLower in sugar and fat than regular sweets\n\nThe shop serves hand-drip Kikuya roasted specialty coffee. There are also chairs where you can take a break.\n\nOn Tuesdays and Saturdays and Sundays, rice flour muffins, chiffon cakes, and sweets are served. On Wednesdays, we sell rice flour bagel and bread. ☆We would be happy if you could feel free to stop by.\n\nWe sell whole-sized cakes and cookies by reservation.\n\nPlease make reservations and orders one week in advance\n\nグルテンフリースイーツmug\n\nhttps://mug.oishii.biz\n#glutenfree",

    "Title": "Just finished a two week trip in Japan in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka as a celiac and thought I would share my experience as this group was extremely helpful for me! \n\nEats in Japan:\nShinjuku - Sakura sushi (a yummy sushi train but they don’t have gf soy sauce so bring your own)\n\nShinjuku - Moyan curry (recommended by this group with GF Japanese curry options. No bookings required when we went) \n\nShinjuku - Ginger grass (this was in our hotel and they had some GF options on their menu. They had Vietnamese cuisine available) \n\nShinjuku - Mikis Cafe (cute cafe we found down the road from our hotel, they had GF muffins and biscuits and did a really yummy smoothie!) \n\nShibuya - Shimbu Sakiya Ramen (recommended by this group. Great GF ramen options, also dumplings and fried chicken. It was delish but quite a small place!) \n\nShibuya - Riz Labo (GF fluffy pancakes, so delicious!) \n\nHarajuku - Ricehack GF baby (I didn’t eat anything from here cause it was too hot and just checked it out. It’s just a hole in the wall place with pizza, bread and a hot dog option which looked nice. No seating) \n\nOsaka - Gengi Soba (GF noodle option with tempura, it was a bit more pricey than other places but so worth it and so good!) \n\nKyoto - Engine Ramen (my favourite meal of the trip hands down! The best ramen with tonnes of GF options. We didn’t have a booking so should be able to walk in) \n\nApart from the above recommendations I wanted to also share some tips from what I found: \n\n1. GF soy sauce is hard to find so I would bring your own from your country if possible to save the hassle\n2. A lot of restaurants didn’t understand when I would ask if there were gluten free options in Japanese, so I always ask in different ways such as “does anything contain soy sauce or have wheat?” \n3. Even though I had lots of options from the group and doing prior research, I still did struggle and GF options were hard to come by. Some of the GF options people recommend are quite far out so you might need to make a trip of it. \n4. A lot of nights we got bits from the supermarket such as crackers, dip, meats, sushi and did that for dinner at our hotel, we loved it and you can’t go wrong! \n5. I lived off Salmon onigiri from the 7/11s and Family Marts. I found they were the only real safe option. \n\nHope this helps and thank you to everyone that also helped me!\n\n#celiac #shinjuku #osaka #kyoto #shibuya #curry #ramen #tips #recommendations #onigiri",

Very good traditional Japanese obanzai food.  The restaurant is in the Yamada building (easy to find via google map directions) and 2 minutes from Yoyogi-Uehara Station.  It is in the same building as Ishii Coffee and you take the stairs on the side of that building.  Went here after touring Meiji Jingue.\nRESERVATIONS:  DM them via their Instagram site.  They would like you to specify Date, Time and Number of people.  The place probably seats a total of 10 - 12 people (they have one table for 4 and 3-4 big couches that surround a big square low wood table).  The place is small so please only reserve if you are certain you can make it and please try not to cancel last minute - def. let them know asap if you can't make it via Insta DM.  The owner/chef preps all food prior to your arrival and does all communication via Insta DM.   The food was so good here, that I really want them to make it!\n****By the way, I had them make my food both gluten free and dairy free.\n****Hours:  As of today, their insta states that they are open for Lunch (11am-2:30pm - last order by 2pm) on Thursday through Sunday.",

    "Title": "A huge thank you for everyone’s contribution to this group. It made planning our trip so much easier! I hope you find my reviews useful!\n\n⚠️VERY LONG POST AHEAD…\nWe are now on our way home after two weeks in Japan for our honeymoon. Please note that as we were celebrating and we are massive foodies, we did splash out. Some places are quite expensive. \n\nI am coeliac as well as having a nut allergy. Most restaurants, I (or our hotel) contacted in advance to make sure they could cater for me and were well prepped before our arrival. \n\n#TOKYO\n\nGonpachi, Asakusa\nThere is a gluten free menu (I believe at this location only), just ask your waiter. Food is delicious (especially the tuna belly), tasted very fresh. \n⏰ Arrived at 11:30 when it opened and were seated immediately.\n💰 Very reasonable for quantity and quality \n\nKuroboshi Churros, Asakusa\nChurros made with rice flour, fried infront of you. There are separate boxes for toppings, the cinnamon sugar is safe and was INCREDIBLE!\n💰 I believe 1x was 500¥\n\nLobelisk\n100% gluten free yakitori restaurant.\nA nice experience, but not our favourite meal. I think we had 6 courses of chicken…and as mentioned in this group by a few others, it’s quite expensive for what you get, but it was great knowing there is no risk. They also had very good wine!\n⏰ Reservation required\n💰💰Set course only \n\nTsukiji Fish Market\nOIDEYA - wagyu & seafood BBQ. All grilled, and torched in front of you. No meat or fish is marinaded, sauces are added onto your plate once cooked, so I just asked for no sauce with my Wagyu and it was delish!\n\nSweet Potato stand - very simple, but surprisingly delicious.\n\nRizlabo\nThe fluffiest, lightest pancakes! I went very classic with just maple syrup. Located down a gorgeous little street, but it’s quite easy to miss (see photo of entrance). It’s definitely worth the trip!\n⏰ We arrived at 3pm and walked straight in, no queue at all. Note: It does take about 20/25mins for them to make.\n💰 Good price for the size!\n\nNobu\nIf you’re celebrating, for us you can’t go wrong at Nobu. We have visited many Nobu’s across the world, and every time the quality, service and experience is fantastic. They are also well trained on allergies and understand cross-contamination risks. Gluten free safe options we ordered: salmon crispy rice, tuna tartare with caviar, miso black cod, roasted leek, a selection of maki rolls and sashimi. \n⏰ Reservation recommended \n💰💰💰\n\nShake Shack\nCheese burger wrapped in lettuce - order at the counter, not through the screens!\n\nShimbu Sakiya Ramen\nWe loved being able to order from the machine outside! Clearly marked up what is gluten free, and I double checked with the staff inside before ordering. I couldn’t believe they served fried chicken, and it was really good. I found the Ramen absolutely delicious.\n⏰ Arrived at 9pm on a Friday, and walked straight in\n💰2x pieces of GF fried chicken 300¥\n\n#KYOTO\n\nYASAKA, Park Hyatt\nThis was by far our favourite meal. Everything was just perfect! Teppanyaki with a sensational view. We had a set menu, with dishes including: sea urchin, cheese, scallops, Wagyu, crab, local tilefish. It was the cleanest teppanyaki I have ever seen, and the chefs took extra care to cook my food separately from others. \n⏰ Reservation required (enquire far in advance)\n💰💰💰 Pricey, but worth it for a celebratory meal\n\nKura Sushi Plus\nThis is a chain sushi conveyor belt restaurant. I’ve seen people mention gluten free soy sauce here, but I couldn’t get any. The staff didn’t speak any English, and when trying to translate they just got confused. There is an allergen sheet though, which makes it easy for ordering. The conveyor belt experience is fun, but I found the sushi to be very average.\n⏰ Expect to queue!\n💰\n\nIkkakuju Karasuma\n100% gluten free okonomiyaki.\nA nice experience again seeing the chefs cook infront of you. However I didn’t find this restaurant to be very clean, and it put me off a little. The okonomiyaki did taste good, but it’s very heavy!\n⏰ Reservation required\n💰\n\nSushi Naritaya, Arashiyama\nHidden behind the main street of food places, an absolute gem of a place! The staff were so kind, and very knowledgeable of gluten allergies (plus they had GF soy sauce!). You can see the chef work, and the wait staff were continually communicating with him to make sure our food was safe. 10/10 sushi, incredible quality! \n⏰ Walked in at 12:30, seated immediately \n💰💰\n\nMr Maurice’s Italian, Ace Hotel\nMy husband was desperate for a pizza after this first week. Luckily, Mr Maurice had gluten free spaghetti. I asked them to cook the pasta in fresh boiling water which they did, and I could choose almost any sauce from their standard menu. Vodka pasta was nice! \n⏰ Reservation recommended\n💰💰\n\n#OKINAWA\n\nWe stayed at Halekulani for a few days, and chose to mostly eat at the resorts restaurants which all had notes of my allergies. Chefs had prepared special plates in advance.\nAOMI - fantastic Shabu Shabu\nKingdom - great steak & chicken\nShiroux - a unique take on the set western breakfast\nHouse without a key - the most restrictive menu, and not that exciting\n💰💰💰\n\nWe also visited the Ritz-Carlton for lunch after my husband played golf. Food was beautiful and the chef was able to tweak anything from the savoury menu to make it a gluten free version. \n💰💰💰\n\n#OSAKA\n\nMatsusakagyu Yakiniku M Hanare \nFabulous cooking experience, one of our top meals! All the meat is great quality Wagyu, they have GF soy sauce, and each table has its own clean grill. Highly, highly recommend!\n⏰ Reservation required\n💰💰\n\nLa Baie, Ritz-Carlton\nThis holds 1 Michelin Star ⭐️ \nA beautiful, intimate dinner for our last night. The food was divine! The chef tweaked the classic course menu to fit my requirements, so I didn’t feel left out. It is expensive, but reasonable for a Michelin star restaurant in our opinion. \n⏰ Reservation required \n💰💰💰\n\nW Hotel\nBreakfast is outstanding here! Buffet style across two large rooms, all food has allergens listed, and the chefs are around for any questions. A huge selection!\n💰💰",

I've already been twice in Japan and I had a wonderful and safe experience thanks to this amazing group!\nI'm planning to go back to Kansai (#Kyoto and surroundings, #Osaka, #Nara) but this time I'd like to stay in a place with a little kitchen and buy local foods in the #supermarkets. I can't read kanjis so I would only scan the labels with my phone. I read your previous posts and took note of some chains and goods.\nI have some (maybe stupid) questions:\n- would you suggest an area in Kyoto/Osaka where it's easier to find gf goods?\n- do supermarkets have a dedicated gf section?\n- are naturally gf unprocessed foods usually safe (fruits, vegetables, rice, meat, plain yoghurt, cheese, canned tuna)?\n- do a lot of gf Japanese goods have the English \"gluten free\" label as the imported items?\n- do they always accept credit cards?\n- can I use my own reusable bag?\nThanks in advance for your help!",

This is possible in Japan, in my experience, but only if you accept that there may be many many times when you are not eating with your group of friends. (Depending on where in Japan you are going of course). \nAfter I changed my “foodie mindset” of travel and instead focused on the people I might meet, the culture, the language, the history, the EVERYTHING that is so amazing in Japan, then it suddenly becomes quite acceptable to make do with daily 7-11 trips for food, added to with snacks I bring from home, and occasionally you get a wonderful experience of finding somewhere you can eat with your group and it becomes a wonderful highlight of your trip! Many restaurants in Japan are very small and I felt it unreasonable to take an extra seat to sit with my family while they ate, so often I would go for a walk and explore by myself, just taking in the sights, instead of the miserable alternative of watching my family consume bowls of udon. I hope you love the country and are prepared to “fuel” your body with food that suits you, rather than experience the cuisine fully.",

I forget to take a photo but it was a decent size and really delicious.\n\nRice Flour Taiyaki Stand a block over from the road between the station and castle is a covered walking street with some cool murals on the ground. I stumbled across this Taiyaki store and they told me they were made with rice flour and all fillings were gluten free. I had the custard one but forgot to take a picture. I can’t remember the last time I ate something like this, so so good! I’ve included some pics of the store and signs.\n\n#Hiroshima\n\nCaffè Ponte I had planned to eat dinner here as they have a gluten free menu but we walked past too early for dinner and my feet couldn’t manage the walk back. Have included a pic of their menu.\n\nMoreThan @ The Knot Hiroshima. They have a gluten free menu and OMG one of the best meals we’ve ever had. I had the duck breast, my husband had the chicken and we shared a plate of vegetables. My husband isn’t a big veggie eater but tried and liked every vegetable, I wish we’d got the large plate! We had the crème caramel and cheesecake for dessert. All of the dishes we ordered were gluten free. The service and food were incredible. Regret we only had one night in Hiroshima so couldn’t go back a second time.\n\nMoreThan @ The Knot Hiroshima have a set menu with four choices. You can’t have the bread or sausage but it was more than enough for me without. \n\n#Miyajima\n\nMiyajima Base. With the amount of food I’d eaten in the previous days I wasn’t overly hungry so I had three prices of chicken with sparkling lemonade for lunch.

The chef, who is young and humorous, studied in Italy and has extensive knowledge of gluten-free meals. When I made a reservation, I mentioned that both my son and I have celiac disease. Despite having to prepare 25 dishes, he managed to make all of them gluten-free, and even crafted a special gluten-free bread for us. The food was spectacular! Moreover, the wine pairing was exceptional.\n\nThe restaurant only hosts one seating per day, with a single table accommodating up to 12 people. The table is designed like an amphitheater, with the kitchen acting as the stage, where guests can observe the entire food preparation process. Additionally, the entire cooking team actively engages in conversation, taking turns to interact with the diners and share insights, making the experience both intriguing and entertaining.\n\nI should also mention that the chef accommodated vegetarian guests, and both couples were delighted with their food.\n\nI highly recommend this place for its exceptional dining experience, personalized service, and outstanding food quality. \n\nhttps://takayama-kyoto.com/en/",

We have managed to find bits & pieces so far but a good supply from home will tide you over until you get additional supplies. We have a duffel style bag full of food which will become our dirty laundry bag at the end. We all have easy access to this bag if we need specific foods.

    "Title": "Just returned from 2 fantastic weeks in Japan with 2 x GF/DF (dairy free) coeliacs and 2 x eat anything-ers. Very grateful to all those who have posted and mentioned places in this group - it was absolutely invaluable! The DF factor added another level of complication to several places, but we managed pretty well. \n\nMost of the places we ate at have already been mentioned here, but just thought I'd give a quick wrap up of where we ate and add some DF information for any GF and DF folks out there:\n\n#tokyo\nGluten Free T's Kitchen (https://glutenfree.co.jp/home-en/) - classic spot for GF'ers in Tokyo. Highlights were the okonomiyaki and fried chicken. So good to have a place where all allergens are noted and easily identifiable.\n\nSoranoiro ramen (https://soranoiro-vege.com/shops-en/soranoirotokyoeki.html) - was a bit tricky to find and a bit of a wait, but really good ramen. However, the GF ramen seemed to be much smaller in size than the normal ramen, so our GFers were left a bit hungry...\n\nShochikuen cafe (https://shochiku-en.jp/cafe/) - stopped for dessert here - the strawberry and lemon cakes here were a real highlight! \n\nSushiro (Asakusa) - A sushi train chain restaurant with an allergen menu online, but we noticed that the names of the dishes on the allergen list and what was available on the in-store menu didn't always correlate. Sushi was average quality. No GF soy sauce in sight, so we used our own.\n\nNabezo (Shibuya) - Chain of sukiyaki/shabu-shabu restaurants. Seemed to be quite knowledgeable about GF and DF and let us know exactly what was safe and unsafe. They offered GF tamari and ponzu as well. Not sure we took full advantage of the all-you-can-eat menu, so go on a very empty stomach! :)\n\nRizlabo pancakes (https://www.rizlabo.com/) - Our GF/DFers loved these so much we went back twice! Only the strawberry and plain could be made GF and DF (without cream), as there is milk in the sauces for the other pancakes. Nevertheless, the strawberry was still a major hit!\n\nEsoragato udon (https://www.instagram.com/esoragoto_udon/?igshid=NTc4MTlwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D) - we were so lucky to find this really great little place after quickly checking this group while we were away. If you are in the Harajuku/Shinjuku area do yourself a favour, get down here and get either the curry udon (if you like a bit of spice) or wagyu udon with an onsen egg - both were fantastic! Not sure if curry udon was DF, but all the others on the menu seemed to be. Don't be put off by the standing room only - food comes out in a hurry and is made to be gulped down quickly! We thought it was so good we went twice - and honestly, you couldn't tell the udon was made without wheat.\n\nHinomaru (yakiniku in Shinjuku) (https://www.hotpepper.jp/strJ001283896/) - The waitress seemed a bit perplexed when I explained that soy sauce contains gluten, but nevertheless, they brought out meat and veg to grill without any sauces or other seasonings on the top. We were then left to our own devices to grill away. Used our own GF soy sauce for dipping here.\n\n#hakone\nNukafuku (https://www.instagram.com/nukafuku/?igshid=ZDdkNTZiNTM%3D) - right outside the exit of Gora station, almost missed it! Great little GF donuts that are donut shaped but actually taste more like cake. Noticed they also sell packets of the little GF soy sauce fish, packet GF ramen and GF granola (although this was out of stock when we visited). \n\n#kyoto\n\nSushi Naritaya (near Arashiyama)(Japan, 〒616-8385 Kyoto, Ukyo Ward, 嵯峨天龍寺芒ノ馬場25嵐山スクエアウエストパ―ク) - had a long wait, but it was worth it for the very high quality sushi here. Staff were knowledgeable and guided us towards the GF/DF offerings (almost everything on the menu) and provided GF soy sauce as well.\n\nMusubi sweets cafe (https://musubi-cafe.jp/arashiyama) - Stopped in here for cake one afternoon and were very glad that we did. Great little cafe - who would have thought that GF/DF tofu \"cheesecake\" could be so tasty! If we had been in the area again, would definitely have gone back here!\n\nChoice (https://hs-choice.com/) - GF and vegan restaurant with really great meals and desserts. Also make really good smoothies and home-made cola. Highly recommended and would definitely go here again!\n\nIkkaukuju Karasuma (https://www.ikkaku10.com/) - GF okonomiyaki, teppanyaki and yakisoba restaurant. Were knowledgeable about GF and DF and gave us okonomiyaki without the mayo (apparently it has dairy in it). Yakisoba was very tasty as well. If you're hungry, make sure you go for the large sized okonomiyaki :)\n\nYak & Yeti (https://yakyeti.owst.jp/) - great Nepalese food. Were knowledgeable about GF and DF and had 1 set menu that our GF/DF duo could enjoy - substituted with poppadoms for naan bread. Very tasty curries!\n\nCafe & Bar Maru (https://maru.keika.kyoto/) - had a great dinner here. The owner was very friendly and very knowledgeable about GF and DF. Highly recommend the katsu, hamburger steak and fried chicken here. Took the whole family for dinner, so don't worry about the \"bar\" vibe in the evenings. Would definitely have gone back if we had more time!\n\nKyoto Engine Ramen - mentioned heaps of times in this group and was well worth going. Was a little skeptical after reading some google reviews saying \"not authentic\", \"worst ramen\" and \"tourist trap\". Although, maybe there is something wrong with us, because we all thought it was great! Sure, it's different to other ramen places, but it tasted great!\n\nTorori Tenshi no Warabi-mochi ([https://www.torori-tenshi-no-warabimochi.com/](https://www.torori-tenshi-no-warabimochi.com/)) - Half of our crew were not sure about the squidgy texture and flavour combos of warabi mochi from here (green tea or roasted soy bean). Having said that, the other half really enjoyed it and it was GF and DF after all. Eat it over the tray as it has a habit of falling out of your chopsticks on to the ground :(\n\nWaco crepes (https://www.wacocrepes.com/) - Great tasting crepes that are packed with filling. DF (or vegan versions) use coconut-flavoured cream as normal cream substitute (in case you are not a coconut fan). Choc-banana crepes were a highlight!!\n\n#HIROSHIMA\n\nRoopali Honten (www.roopali.jp) - very tasty Indian food. Were knowledgeable about GF and DF - said the curries could be done with a cashew base so that they were DF. Great value lunch sets that were yum!\n\n#nara\n\nTotal Therapy cafe - Kururu (http://www.nl-kururu.com/index.html) - Appreciate the idea of this cafe, which is more or less summed up as \"healing through food\". Most of the menu seemed to be out of stock when we visited so we didn't get to try a wide variety of dishes. Curry and rice was pretty good, though.\n\n#universalstudiosjapan\n\nHad a great day at USJ and spent a lot of time researching where we could eat that would be GF/DF on the day. Got busted at the entry trying to smuggle our snacks in - manager was called over and we explained in Japanese that these were snacks for people with allergies in our group. He said it was fine to take them in, but we were not allowed to eat them out in the open and that they had allergen menus at many restaurants so could we please buy lunch there. We obliged and had lunch at the Parkside grill, where our GF/DFers ate from the allergy menu with a hamburger steak and teriyaki chicken. Honestly, for the price, these lunch sets were pretty good value - you wouldn't be able to get half as much for the same price at any theme park here in Australia. Staff were knowledgeable and came over and asked what the allergies were and then showed what could be ordered. Made the experience a lot less stressful, although there was a booking system for these restaurants in effect when we were there, so reserve your time early or you'll end up waiting around for an hour when you are already hungry!\n\nA few other tips (if you're still reading):\n* Took plenty of little GF soy sauce fish with us, but only ended up using about 3 or 4 (hot tip if you are in Australia - just pop down to your local Sushi Sushi and ask them if you can just buy the GF soy sauce fish - they gave us about 20 for a couple of bucks).\n* Took 2 loaves of GF bread with us, but probably could have done with 1 extra as we found GF and DF bread pretty hard to come by. Managed to find some small rolls in a pharmacy just outside Nara station (Kinouta Pharmacy Nara train station, 8-1 Aburasaka Jikatacho, Nara, 630-8246, Japan), but didn't have much luck at any Natural Lawson's or other supermarkets in Tokyo or Kyoto.\n* We did have some luck with GF cereal in Natural Lawson's - found some plain corn flakes at a few stores.\n* If you are DF, soy milk is everywhere and comes in all sorts of flavours not available in Australia - chocolate, banana, strawberry, peach, melon, tea, tropical fruit (!!)\n* BUT, we didn't manage to find any truly DF margarine while we were there. Plenty of margarine, but it all had at least some dairy mixed in.\n* Our GF/DF crew were a bit over convenience store onigiri and boiled eggs after the first few days, so spread these out across your trip :)\n\nThanks for reading - happy to answer any questions!",

    "Title": "We just returned from my trip to Japan and I want to give a huge heartfelt thanks to the admins of this wonderful group!!\n\nYou know you did a good job when your 12 year old daughter with Celiac says, “Mom, I thought you said it would be hard to eat gluten-free in Japan?” 😂. If she only knew the months and months of info I’ve been collecting from this group to make it seem seamless.\n\nTo pay if forward here are a few of our experiences to help others…\n\n#1 - we did a tour through Trafalgar (Tour name: The Splendors of Japan) and I was weary of their ability to help us with GF since other tours we’ve taken in other countries didn’t do such a great job. They were fantastic! Every meal we had with them, which included a sushi class and specialty restaurants all prepared GF options without us saying a thing.\n\nI had packed literally half a suitcase of food for her (I’m an anxious over planner) and she only had to use her emergency supply twice during a 9 day tour. Much of that was due to what I also learned in this group.\n\n#tokyo\n\n#whereisthedog\nNear the #Ghibli Museum we ate at Where is a Dog (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Wnei9PLeppGVFxFG9?g_st=ic). What an amazing place of GF food. Home cooked and such friendly owners. We were also able to purchase GF bagels and muffins that turned into a life saver the next day.\n\nThere are tons of options in Tokyo. We were on the tour most of our time in Tokyo so didn’t need to use any of the group suggestions.\n\n#kanazawa\n\n#Aashirwad\nI had planned for us to go to Love for All, but had heard mixed experiences in this group and then luckily stumbled on a post that mentioned they won’t serve kids due to having an alcohol license - that made me scramble, but I went to the highly recommended Aashirwad (https://maps.app.goo.gl/5deoUcBfvBAeNsBa8?g_st=ic) Indian food. They were English speaking and were able to clearly tell me everything that was GF on their menu (which was almost everything)! Also CRAZY good food.\n\n#shiromcrepe\nWe also went to Sharon Creperie the next day (https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hs368ZvY5PQKHWob8?g_st=ic) for lunch. They had both sweet and savory GF crepes that were so delicious. We watched her make them in front of us and it was so fresh and well made. \n\n#kyoto\n\n#gionsoymilk\nGION Soy Milk Ramen Uno Yokiko (https://maps.app.goo.gl/6hQGJzwS947GGPDw9?g_st=ic) was so delicious and everything is GF, so my daughter got to try her first Goyza!\n\nBONUS… don’t miss this 👀\nthere is a Gluten Free vending machine in front of the restaurant that has GF desserts, including the popular cake-in-a-can as well as donuts. It was so fun for my daughter to be part of the vending machine experience 😂. They do come out frozen, so open it a bit later. We made the mistake of opening them and walking around with frozen cake while it thawed.\n\n#ikkakuju\nI was on the hunt to find gluten free okonomiyaki for my daughter. Luckily we were in the area where I pinned this restaurant: Ikkakuju - Shijo Shimmachi (https://maps.app.goo.gl/RgzpoeaGfAqUL5KN8?g_st=ic). She ironically didn’t get the okonomiyaki, but picked the risotto instead. It was the best risotto I have ever tasted. I enjoyed the okonomiyaki as well. All gluten free!\n\nAlso our hotel, Hotel Higashiyama (https://maps.app.goo.gl/aPYw5kBrNErQCwcHA?g_st=ic ) had a little counter of cookies beautifully packaged for gifts. they actually had a tin of gluten free cookies. Made for a nice gift for some GF friends back home.\n\n#starbucks\nAlso, if you are in Japan before July 9th, 2024 try the banana brûlée line only available in Japan that is made from rice flour. I wouldn’t have known to look for it if it weren’t for this group (Christie’s post about it). It was SO good and it was a great snack at the airport where there were less options for my daughter.\n\nI had so many places pinned on my google map because of this group. It made our trip so much less stressful.\n\nThank you 🙏\n\nIt is very possible to have an enjoyable GF experience in Japan, especially with the advice and support of this facebook group ❤️.",

    "Title": "Hi all, \n\nWe just came back from Japan after 15 days discovering this wonderful country. My husband is a symptom-free coeliac that follows a strict gluten-free diet, so we did a bit of research (thanks to this group and other blogs) and bookings before our trip to ensure he’d be able to try Japanese cuisine. Most of the times we base our trips on local food and restaurants, so we wanted to try as many real and local Japanese food as possible. \n\nPlease note that as a symptom-free coeliac he doesn’t get any reaction in case of cross-contamination, but we did our best explaining how they should cook to avoid the risk. Of course, we were carrying our own gluten-free soy sauce everywhere and we brought madeleines and bread for breakfast. \n\nTOKYO: \n- Soranoiro Ramen (Tokyo Station): it took us a while to find it but it was worth it. \n\n- Kura sushi: I suggest to go during the first days of your trip, cause as the days go by and you try better sushi, the experience will be different. But we loved it. Gluten-free soy sauce was not available once.\n\n- Shimbu Sakiya Ramen (Shibuya): we tried the fried chicken and the dumplings. They were really nice, and the ramen looked amazing.\n\n- Tsukiji Market: although a bit touristy and overpriced, we found some places offering options that are naturally gluten-free that were really tasty: Grilled Wagyu Beef (amazing beef skewers) or Maguroya Kurogin (great sashimi and nigiris), or another one offering grilled crab. \n\n- Comburger (Cooking class in Shinjuku): can’t recommend enough this experience. We cooked at Sato’s place, who lived in the USA and moved back to Japan, a full gluten-free home meal (spring tofu salad, a super rich soup, chicken karaage/fried, and rice with seaweed). Super experience!\n\n- Ise Sueyoshi: lovely kaiseki experience based on food from the Mie prefecture. We were only four, and my husband’s menu was completely adapted. The chef is well aware of the gluten-free diet. Highly recommended. \n\n- Yakitori alley (Yurakucho): we wanted to spot some salarymen afterwork, so we had a fun experience while eating salted yakitoris which were delicious. \n\n- Otsuna Sushi (Roppongi): great omakase experience. The chef was well aware of the gluten-free diet and adapted the menu to gluten-free. They also provided gluten-free sauce. Highly recommended. \n\n- Gluten free Kushiage Su (Ginza): it was a nice experience for only 6 people seated at the counter, everything is gluten free and fried skewers were nice. Personally, coming from Spain where it is easy to find gluten free deep fried food (mainly fish or croquetas using chickpea flour), this was a bit overpriced experience and I would probably not go again. But if you’re not used to gluten-free deep fried food, then you must go. \n\n- Hoshinoya hotel (Otemachi): no words to describe this incredible hotel. They were also able to accommodate the western breakfast to gluten-free, and gluten free bread was included! \n\nKANAZAWA:\n- Omicho market: there were different options, mainly seafood. We also ended up having some sushi there. \n\n- Fuwari: they were aware of the gluten-free diet and provided gluten-free soy sauce. We had some lovely yakitoris. \n\nSHIRAKAWA-GO: we went for the day and we were trying to find a safe place to eat. Unfortunately some were closed (do not trust google’s opening and closing times in Japan, as many times it turned out to be misleading). However we found a meat place (yakiniku) out of the touristy area which was really nice. We had very nice Hida beef. \n\nTAKAYAMA: \n- Heinraku: it was an absolute pleasure. The restaurant is managed by a lovely couple that are well aware of the gluten-free diet and have a specific menu. We had great gyozas, fried chicken, and gluten free beer! Highly recommended. \n\n- Matsuki Ushi: again the times of some restaurants were wrong in google, so we asked in the lobby of the hotel for a place to have lunch and they recommended this one. Great Hida beef and wagyu nigiris! \n\nKYOTO: \n- Ikkakuju - Shijo Shimmachi: it turned out to be very close to our hotel and everything was gluten free. We tried the okonomiyaki for the first time and it was really nice. \n\n- Kyoto engine ramen: super nice ramen with different gluten free options. The soup was super rich and delicious. Highly recommended\n\n- Kobe Beef Steak Mouriya Gion: amazing experience. The chef was well aware of the things that my husband could not eat and the meat was just delicious. Highly recommended \n\n- MOON and BACK Ramen Bar & Branch Cafe: incredible gluten free ramen. Different from the engine ramen, but also delicious. Highly recommended. \n\n-Breizh cafe: they had really nice gluten free crêpes. \n\nHIROSHIMA AND MIYAJIMA: \n- Caffè Ponte: lovely terrace with an additional gluten free menu. Risotto was very nice. Not local food, but due to time constraints we didn’t have many options. \n\n- Miyajima Grand Hotel Arimoto: we were staying at this hotel which was well located in the island. For dinner, they offered a kaiseki course which was fully accommodated for a gluten free diet. It also included their local famous Oysters. It was lovely. For breakfast they could only accommodate the western breakfast. \n\nOSAKA\n- Itamae Yakiniku Issho Edobori: we wanted to have dinner close to our hotel and it was amazing. They understood our needs and didn’t marinate the beef and explain what may contain gluten. The beef was amazing. Highly recommended \n\n- OKO takoyaki vegan vegetarian glutenfree: we had to try the takoyaki, and these were gluten free and nice. However, as non vegetarian we missed trying glutenfree octopus takoyaki, the famous one in Osaka. \n\n- Kitashinchi Okurano: no words can describe this kaiseki. We informed about the coeliac disease when we did the reservation and at first we were not sure they had understood it as we got an email in Japanese. The staff at the hotel called to be sure and they confirmed. We were seated at the counter, only the two of us, admiring how they were preparing the meal. So exquisite, so nice.. They fully accommodated my husband’s menu. They barely spoke English but we were able to communicate with a translation app. Highly recommended\n\n- Sushi Sōichi: also an unforgettable experience. We had an omakase course in a very local and tiny restaurant where the chef was extremely nice (although we needed to translate most of our conversations). He was able to accommodate all the food to gluten free and was fine with us using our own gluten free soy sauce (he even used it to prepare some courses)! Highly recommended, not cheap but definitely a delicious and unforgettable experience. \n\nHope this helps those coeliac friends wondering whether to go to Japan or not. I definitely recommend you to go!! I have not included any reference to combini foods as there’s a lot of useful information in this group.",

I am just working through each day and making sure I have a list of places for where we are going to be. \nMy question is for Disneyland/DisneySea - I see there are hot chips available and have noted that these are listed GF on a previous spreadsheet posted on the group. Do they use separate fryers just for the chips? I have searched the website and the allergen for the listed is soy. Will I need to check each restaurant while we are there?

In our case, it only lists wheat - there is no listing for gluten or other rye, barley, oats, etc so you have to be comfortable with taking wheat as a proxy for gluten. We do - my daughter is coeliac and also anaphylactic to some nuts and has had a scope soon after eating at Disney with no damage. Also, be careful as not all French fries at all locations are safe but the Disney tool will only list those with a separate fryer.\nHere’s the link to save you the search: https://fsp.tokyodisneyresort.jp/en/s/info",

    "Title": "Now that I have returned from my trip to Tokyo, I wanted to give back to this group some things I ate and found out. \n\nFirst off, yakiniku places were a lifesaver for me. All I did was Google places nearby and all of them that I went to either accommodated allergies or provided no sauce and switched out their grills for every new customer, so I felt safe. \n#yakiniku\n\nAnother lifesaver on days when I was too tired to venture out, was Frijoles and Guzman y Gomez. I stayed at Hotel Indigo in Shibuya and although they had a restaurant that had gluten free options, Frijoles was on the ground floor and is super quick and cheap. I just ordered a rice bowl at these \"Chipotle\" type restaurants to avoid any issues and never got sick. As for Guzman y Gomez, I ate there a few times when staying near Tokyo Disneyland as they have an allergy list and it was also quick and less expensive. \n#tokyo #disney\n\nAlso in the Ikspiari at Tokyo Disney, they have a Korean yakiniku called Yakiniku Toraji that took gluten free seriously and provided items without sauce and also their online menu mentioned if items had wheat in them. As for food at Disneyland and Disneysea, as others mentioned, the turkey leg, most popcorn, ice pops, and the curry were safe, but to add onto that, doing mobile order for quick service places was the easiest I found in checking allergies and getting food quickly. A lot of the times we beat lines,  and you can check each item for wheat. \n#disney\n\nAt Teamlab Borderless, they didn't have food but had a tea cafe, which I warn to be cautious. Their menu said drinks were gluten free but one drink was a barley tea labeled gluten free and that made me skeptical of all drinks. The yuzu green tea seemed okay. \n#teamlabborderless\n\nAt the WB Harry Potter Studio Tour, the food didn't seem safe aside from drinks, Butterbear, and popcorn. \n#harrypotter\n\nLastly, I relied on conbinis a lot for breakfast as most places don't open until 10am and we got up a lot earlier than that. My regular food was salted eggs, yogurt, apple juice, and whatever fruit they had available from strawberries to bananas, cherries and grapes. This was also a go-to if we couldn't find a safe place to eat nearby.\n#conbini\n\nOverall, what I found out from this experience is that Japan does take allergies seriously, but many places don't seem to fully understand the difference between wheat and gluten, cross contamination was less of a worry for me due to their cleanliness, and sometimes I just took chances on foods and hoped for the best. For instance at Tokyo Skytree they have a bunch of food places and there was a strawberry soft serve that I risked and it was delicious.  \n\nI hope this is helpful and not too repetitive.",

(You can book a private class if you want to be certain of no cross-contamination, for me it’s not so much of an issue) \n\nIt also meant that I still felt like part of the group throughout and got to learn the different recipes and method for both gf and regular by watching the others.\n\nThe ramen was hands down the best I’ve had and I’m already looking forward to giving it a go back home. \n\nThe best part of the day is Nahoko herself, she invites you into her home (which means you get to visit an off-the-beaten track part of the city) and she makes you feel very welcome. She is so knowledgeable and kind hearted. We learnt so much and left absolutely stuffed! \n\nSide note: We were there from 10:30-3:15 plus travel time from our hotel was about 1 hour total,  so we made sure we had the full day just for this and one easy activity in the early evening. You do need this much time as it’s a lot to go through and you want to enjoy it, not clock watch. \n\nIf you have the time in your trip, I cannot recommend this unique experience enough! 🫶\n\nhttp://bit.ly/4144rwz",

I hope it helps.\n\n#glutenfree #vegetarian #vegan #celiac \n\nTokyo:\n\nCafè Tarot - breakfast and luch. It is completely gluten free (should be safe for celiac too). Their muffins are to die for, so so so good, especially the lemon ones and the blueberry ones too. The burger bun was so soft (down side is that is also vegan, so the burger was soy meat based). The plus side, if you are into Tarot cards, this place is amazing, they have all sorts of decks and a museum nearby.\n\nAddress: 1 Chome-27-3 Asakusabashi, Taito City, Tokyo 111-0053, Japan\n\nhttps://en.cafe-tarot.tokyo/\n\nNagano:\n\nEnishi - gluten free bakery and safe for celiacs. Best cinnamon rolls I ever had! Most of their goods are baked using sorghum.\n\nAddress: 2 Chome-1-23 Wakasato, Nagano, 380-0928, Japan\n\nhttps://enishi-sorghum.com/\n\n信州十割そば てん - soba noodles restaurant. They have a gluten free soba dish (hot/cold 100% buckwheat noodles) with gluten free tempura (they have a Japanese menu but it says Gluten-Free and the waitress was very helpful). I am not sure if it is 100% safe for celiacs (not sure if there is potential contamination) but worked for my intollerance. Really lovely soba ramen, the broth had a delicate taste. This place is just outside the station, in the square. \n\nAddress: Japan, 〒380-0823 Nagano, Minamichitose, 1 Chome−22−7 力丸ビル １F",

    "Title": "Okinawa Gluten Free Recommendations. Please see my notes for each place, not all are 100% gluten free so eat at your own risk. \n\n- Anjinmoko\nThis place is 100% gluten free and very safe, they also accommodate other allergies and have vegan options. My favorite here are the pancakes and the chicken sandwich. This is one of my favorites places. The owner is very kind and doesn't speak English, so please be patient and use a translation app if you need, but the menu is easy to understand. She knows me very well and will take good care you.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/9miNLzB2WTEQWkRU8?g_st=ic\n\n- 52Hertz Cafe\nThis is also 100% Gluten Free and caters to other food allergies. The owner is super kind and loves taking care of people. She's Good friend and always willing to accommodate as much as possible! I love her karage and potato box, Fresh baked breads, as well as the burger plate. She has many other frozen foods you can buy to-go and cook in your hotel microwave or Air BnB.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/PweB1imF3akW5JNP7?g_st=ic\n\n- Mama Lella\nThis restaurant is 100% Gluten Free and the owner converted this restaurant to be GF after realizing he had an issue. It's fantastic Italian Food and the owner (He's from Italy) is a great guy and runs the restaurant with his wife. Contact them ahead of time to make reservations. Definitely amazing food here and wine!\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/yx5r9nNagZNCpJ7e9?g_st=ic\n\n- Osteria La Pesciolin\nThis is an Italian restaurant specializing in seafood. It's NOT gluten free, however the owner here is my best friend and started preparing gluten free food for me. I go here at least once a week. You MUST let them know you are gluten free, speak to the owner Mr. Nasu and tell him Evan recommended it for GF pasta and ask what else he has available as well or what he can make you that's off the menu. Definitely try his fried mozzarella! He understands how to prepare GF foods and anything boiled or fried is done in non contaminated water/oil. He always has a great choice of fantastic wines and of course the raw oysters are sublime. \n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/phyv98WZSQVNSrA57?g_st=ic\n\n- Spice Cury Kofta\nThis place is also NOT a gluten free restaurant, but many of their foods are made safe to eat. You have to speak with the owner and his wife and let them know your needs. Anything and everything they make is fantastic.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/NZWv1xYcJ2rzUfu56?g_st=ic\n\n- Cafe Halcyon\nThis is NOT a gluten free spot, but they make a gluten free crepe. It is cooked in the same area as everything else, so since I have celiac I don't eat the crepes here, if you're mildly sensitive you might be alright, I go here for their GF/vegan chocolate chip cookies!!! Go when they open because sometimes the cookies sell out.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/4tjjPp7FyWUQ9nRP8?g_st=ic\n\nThese are my main recommendations for safe eating. There are other places that say they have gluten free foods available, I don't try them because the risk is too high. I own a restaurant here called Bacon Bar Japan and I used to offer GF food but stopped marketing as such because we make our own breads/dough and cross contamination is very likely, I get sick often just working in my own restaurant, so be careful and ask questions when eating out. I tend to stay away from Japanese and Okinawan food restaurants because there's just too much of a risk, and many places will tell you their food is safe but they don't understand that Japanese soy sauce and mizuame as well as some vinegar has wheat. There is a fancy market called Rogers that sells a bunch of GF snacks that are imported from around the world, so check that place out if you need snacks. Good luck and be safe!",

Green is for places I really wanted to visit because they were highly recommended - regardless of whether I visited them in the end. \nYellow signposts are for supermarkets/grocery stores which offer something gluten free.\nAccommodation which is said to do GF in some capacity is marked as a salmon-coloured bed. There are a few places to visit that are not food related noted on this map just to show proximity to major sites.

We arrived and they actually did make me special food! When we checked in at each meal they had a note for the front staff that there was an allergy in the room and they confirmed each time who it was. For dinner there was a buffet plus a choice of three \"main dishes\" and they let me know that the beef dish could be made with no sauce. For breakfast, I got a tofu and vegetable soup brought to me before my husband joined and he didn't get any soup when he finally got there, haha.

I did some googling. \n\nI wanted to find out if the Japanese 28 allergen system's \"wheat\" is similar to the certified GF in the US.  \n\nIt seems that in the USA, the FDA has a strict threshold of less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten for a product to be labeled gluten-free. This is considered one of the strictest standards globally. While not mandatory, many manufacturers opt for third-party certification from organizations like the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (GFCO) to provide additional assurance. \n\nIn Japan the threshold for gluten in gluten-free labeled products, instead, relies on a \"not detectable\" standard based on current testing methods. And like in the US, some manufacturers may voluntarily obtain certification from organizations like the Japanese Consumer Co-operative Union (JCCU) to provide additional assurance.\n\nSo if this is accurate, then the Japanese system might be even better than that of the US, but I do wonder what \"Current testing methods\" means, as I couldn't find details of what kind of equipment is used. \n\nIE If the US equipment is very sensitive, and the Japanese is not very sensitive then none of this means anything....  \n\nIf it is the same equipment in both countries, I would certainly prefer not detectable.  \n\nDoes anyone else know more about this?\n\nEDIT:  I just found this. \n\nA landmark study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2007 found that 10 mg of gluten per day was the lowest level at which some individuals with celiac disease experienced intestinal damage (villous atrophy). And that 50 mg of gluten per day was considered harmful for most people with celiac disease.\n\nSo the current consensus is that consuming a diet containing less than 20 parts per million (ppm) of gluten is generally considered safe for individuals with celiac disease. This is because a diet at this level should keep most people below the 10 mg threshold when considering the cumulative amount of gluten consumed throughout the day. \n\nPersonally I will try to avoid any at all, as I notice symptoms shortly after consumption, so villous atrophy, isn't my only concern.",

        "Message": "In New Zealand and Australia (it’s a combined regulation authority - Food Standards Australia and New Zealand) they use testing kits that can measure quite low, so have decided that less than 3ppm is the accepted limit here. But like you’ve described for Japan, in NZ legislation it doesn’t explicitly refer to the 3ppm - only that the product can claim it’s GF if there is no detectable gluten or oats or cereals containing gluten that may have been malted.\n\nIt’s interesting to think for example we sell Lindt milk chocolate here in NZ which contains barley so us coeliacs in NZ/AU naturally avoid it, but in the UK the same package can be labelled gluten-free because it’s less than 20ppm so coeliacs there will eat it.",

    "Title": "LONG POST! Thank you to this Facebook Group for making our trip to Japan so wonderful!  We just got back and want to give back to this group for all the help you gave me in planning our trip so I could eat gluten free and delicious food.  Here are my tips and restaurant information to share:\n\nNote that ALL of the restaurants listed here except one took credit cards!!  In my research I learned that most restaurants prefer cash.  That was not my experience, even in some small restaurants.\n\nNot all of the restaurants are easy to find.  I recommend giving yourself enough time to get lost before your reservation time. Show up on time or a few minutes early for reservations in Japan.  It's not unusual for reservations to be cancelled by the restaurant if you show up 10 minutes late.  \n\nDo your best to make reservations in advance for the restaurants below.  Things went much smoother when we had them than trying to find availability at places at the last minute.  \n\nYou can have a great time and enjoy delicious gluten free food in Japan.  It just takes a some planning in advance.  I hope this post helps you do that!  \n\n**TOKYO:**\n\nGluten Free T's Kitchen: 2F, 7-8-5 Roppongi, Minato-Ku, Tokyo 106-0032\n\nThis restaurant was probably the most disappointing on our trip.  The food was not really great but, it was a relief to know that anything I ate there would not make me sick because the restaurant is entirely gluten free.  It does give a sense of comfort to those of us who are anxious about being \"glutened\" while on an international trip which is saying something however there are other restaurants that have been recommended by this group that are likely much better quality.\n\n**Takayama:**\n\nSakurajaya Restaurant: 3 Chrome-84-13 Sowamachi, Takayama, Gifu 506-0007\n\nThis was one of the BEST restaurants we went to on our trip!  Highly recommend.  They happen to be open on Tuesdays which is a day that most restaurants are closed.  Food is AMAZING!  The owner/chef speaks some English and made sure I knew what was gluten free or could be made gluten free on the menu.  We had an awesome Hida beef dish that we are still talking about.  This was the one restaurant that did NOT take credit cards.  Cash is a must.\n\n**Kyoto:**\n\nSugarhill Kyoto Restaurant: 600-8028 Kyoto, Shimogoyo Ward, Uematsucho 75\n\nThis restaurant will accept reservations via Facebook and reservations are highly recommended.  The food was fine, the prices were very reasonable and we had great service.  I got the chicken teriyaki, which most people had recommended in this group.  It was fine but not great.  Again, this is a restaurant that is great if you want to make sure you are not exposed to gluten but don't expect high quality food.  \n\nGluten Free Cafe and Bar Maru: 600-8012 Kyoto, Shimogyo Ward, Saitocho, 123 RAKAS, 3f\n\nThis was the other outstanding restaurant we experienced.  Highly recommend but know that it's difficult to find from the street.  It's located on the 3rd floor of the non-descript building it's in and has a very small sign on the side of the entrance door to the building.  If you come from the North, you may be able to see it.  If coming from the South, it's easy to overlook.  The building is next to a Family Mart which is easy to spot.  I asked the hotel concierge to make a reservation here on our behalf and glad we did.  The food was truly amazing and the entire menu is gluten free.  It's an attractive interior and most of the customers are westerners looking for high quality, gluten free food.  You will definitely get that here. We had a wonderful meal here!!\n\nWaco Crepes: 605-0801 Kyoto, Higashiyama Ward, Miyagawasuji, 6 Chrome, 355-1\n\nThis is a fun, tiny restaurant that was also a little hard to find.  It's a small store front on a neighborhood street about 1.5 miles north of the Kyoto train station.  We had a great time and enjoyed the food at this restaurant.  Know that they are closed on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.  The crepes were delicious and the staff speaks English very well.  Everyone eating there were westerners looking for gluten free food and we all enjoyed chatting about our travel experiences in Japan and sharing tips about gluten free eating in Japan.  It is a small, delightful place with creative crepe options to consider.  \n\nLoco Chicken: 〒600-8018 Kyoto, Shimogyo Ward, Ichinocho, 253-1 河原町会館 101\n\nThis is a tiny restaurant about .2 miles away from Nishiki Market.  They have gluten free fried chicken that's made with rice flour.  Delicious!  You may have to wait in line outside the restaurant for a seat (they have only 4 or 5 seats total) but it's worth the wait.  Service is fairly quick and the food was really delicious! It's considered fast food and no reservations are taken here.\n\nIkkakuju Karasuma Restaurant: 〒600-8092 Kyoto, Shimogyo Ward, Shinmeicho, 248 グラン・ジュール綾小路 B1F\n\nThis was a very fun restaurant that was also hard to find.  Look for the white Unicorn on the outside of the restaurant (it's placed there after 5pm) and take the stairs down to the restaurant which is underground.  We had a very authentic Japanese restaurant experience here that included taking off our shoes and cooking some of the meal on a shared grill in the middle of the table.  Very fun and the food was really good.  Let them know you have a gluten allergy before ordering.\n\n**Kanazawa:**\n\nOmicho Fish Market: 50 Kamiomicho, Kanazawa, Ishikawa 920-0905, \n\nInside this market is a stall called Omicho Burgers. They were able to make me gluten free beef skewers that were made with salt (called Shio), not soy sauce.  It was a quick meal and very good.  Highly recommend if you need something quick and gluten free while there.",

The culture around those places is quite strict. It's hard to even find places that will allow you to sit without ordering anything, from my experience.\n\nFor speaking out loud, the main words for us were \"arigatou\" (thank you), \"sumimasen\" (excuse me), and \"daijoubu\" (that's OK, I'm OK). For written, 人口 is exit, as mentioned already. 小麦 is wheat if you're reading ingredient labels. 麦 by itself is grain and is used for all the stuff to avoid paired with something else before it, so that's usually what I look for.",

I eat most other things so not super fussy, including fish, but not big on other types of seafood or weird foods. Love rice!!\n\nWe are Aussie 40-60, well travelled, but not yet been to Japan. Don’t speak Japanese either, will try learn a few words prior. We are boarding a cruise in Yokohama which will have stops through Japan and beyond and they are great at catering for GF I hear, but going to stay in Tokyo first probably for approx 3 days, maybe a couple more, depending. \n\nInterested in hearing your suggestions for mid-range or slightly upper-range hotels that have a GF friendly restaurant on site and preferably GF restaurants walking distance (if such a thing exists!?) It is for a special milestone. Assuming a chain type hotel will be a better choice? Also this will Probably help us decide on which airport to fly into. \n\nAs for activities which might help with location, we are interested in taking a fast train trip, (love trains) or 2, maybe doing something JDM (love cars) related, and maybe a general look around and maybe a day trip. We enjoy wine or cocktail bars etc but not clubbing. Interested in enjoying the culture etc but we don’t want a mega packed first few days before the cruise. We will be doing tours on the cruise. \n\nAny other info or suggestions you think will be helpful!! 😃🍁 \n\nTIA 👋🏻",

I’m wondering if you might share your favourite gluten free meals and snacks that you purchased at 7-11 and Lawsons etc just to get us started. We will be arriving in Tokyo quite late in the evening, and we’re thinking of just picking something up quickly on our way to check in at our hotel. We would appreciate any advice or words of wisdom. Many thanks in advance. 🙂",

Also some of the pre cooked fish in 7/11 can be gf as long as they are just salt cooked and not soy 😊\nYou can also buy microwaveable rice that is gf in 7/11 which pairs quite nicely with the fish! Also if you see fried tofu most are gf😊 fried tofu has been one of my favourites! Just have to fry it in a pan with your fave meats or fish and it soaks up all the juices! But always check the back of things to make double sure as different brands make things using different ingredients x",

    "Title": "I just finished a 10 day trip in Japan as a newly diagnosed celiac (January 2024). It was an extraordinary trip and my gut has never been healthier (thanks, vegetables!). I’m grateful for all the tips I learned on this page and others.  Here is what I did to make it work for me.\n\n1.  I bought the legal nomads card.  It was worth it. When I used it, folks read it very carefully, and were very considerate. https://www.legalnomads.com/gluten-free/\n\n2. I learned about 300 words of Japanese using Duolingo and other sources. This enabled me to have basic conversations about what I could eat.  People really seemed to appreciate my efforts to speak Japanese. They were very very patient.\n\n3. ￼ I did a 7-day supported, self guided hike on the Nakasendo Trail, booked through Walk Japan.  Www.walkjapan.com.  I booked the trip before I had the celiac diagnosis, while I was still eating wheat and soy sauce. I had to pivot quickly. Walk Japan handled it superbly – – they got in touch with all the ryokan, and ensured that I had a gf feast at every breakfast and dinner. I still had to have conversations with innkeepers to avoid mistakes. But the result is that I did not feel deprived at all – – I had an extraordinary variety of local cuisines and specialties, and my gut was actually the happiest it has been since I got this diagnosis.  So I give huge kudos to walk Japan for the success of this trip.  (Originally, I was writing up every day on the trail on this Facebook group, including links to places mentioned in my posts, but not including links in the captions to the individual photographs attached to the posts; my posting privileges were suspended after two of these posts, and some photos deleted, when I did not include tags in the photos attached to the posts.  To avoid a repeat, I’m not going to attach any photos to this post.)\n\n4.  In Tokyo, along with “find me gluten-free app,” I learned to love the “depachikas.”  See link below.  These are huge food halls and grocery stores under the biggest department stores.  Most of the food was not safe for celiac. However, at least in the grocery store portion, virtually all the sashimi, and most of the sushi, along with the produce, was safe.  The sushi and sashimi was beautiful, and well priced.  https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/shopping/best-depachika-food-halls-in-tokyo\n\n5.  I bought snacks from home, and gluten-free soy sauce packets, oatmeal packets, peanut butter, and cheese.  I also brought a thermos for food. When I was on the trail, on days where I wasn’t sure if I could find something for lunch, I would make a thermos full of oatmeal mixed with cheese and peanut butter.  The food stayed warm in the thermos, and then I only needed to look for supplemental food like gluten-free, mochi, ice cream, things like that.\n\n6.  Like other people, I supplemented with red salmon flake onogiri from 7-Elevens, and soft boiled eggs also from 7-Elevens (and other combini).\n\n#nakasendo #tokyo",

Also the fish sauce brand that's used a lot there contains gluten as part of the colouring. It's totally doable as a country (especially if you're staying in larger cities) but you'll need to ask for no soy sauce, no fish sauce, salt and sugar only. Another tip I got from within a gf group is don't ask 'does this contain soy sauce or gluten', ask 'what ingredients are in this'? I've forgotten the name for the custom, but in a lot of south east Asian countries it's culturally important to please visitors, so you'll often be given the answer the local person thinks you want to hear, which in a coeliacs case can cause issues. There are quite a few gf cards, but you also need to be cautious eg look at the cooking area and implements if you can. I avoided eating at a few places the rest of my travelling companions did,as even though I believed the cook would change ingredients for me I could see how much Seasoning g was locked into cooking implements. I was also fortunate enough to have access to a fluent Thai speaker for several of the meals on my trip. \nIf you get exhausted double checking all the time there are some specially places in Bangkok and Chiang Mai that   are either dedicated gf or are low gf for their menu and understand c/c they won't guarantee it, but I'd say excluding flour in the air or a total accident from staff they'd be as safe as you can get out of a dedicated gf venue - though they tend to be more western and often double as a vegan venue.",

    "Title": "If you're Tokyo/Shinjuku/Shinagawa/Shibuya-based during your trip, and heading to #kamakura  or #enoshima I suggest you \"force\" a train change (connecting train) by #Ofuna\n\nLet me count thy ways:\n1. BIO-RAL (inside Grandship Mall connected to the train station). Not all Bio-ral branches are created equal. I always go here for gluten-free loaves and gluten-free ready-to-eat Financier and Rucola bars. The microwaveable steamed breads are yummy, too, but since I live  here, I usually opt to make my own mug cake at home using my almond flour stash. Today, I was thrilled to find gluten free shumai and gyoza, gluten free beer, sooooo many gluten free cookie brands (I got Miso flavor from Bio-ral home brand and Maple from Ohsawa brand). They have lots of senbei (salty, spicy, sweet) which are \"naturally\" gluten-free BUT of course, check the other ingredients (I'm gluten intolerant and I don't react to soy sauce and cross contamination). I usually buy gluten free pasta, there, too, and other condiments. They have rice flour cakes, too (I didn't check cross-contamination).\n2. JUPITER (inside Grandship Mall too). They have lots of crisp breads and corn chips, popcorn, and chocolate that are clearly marked gluten free. They have lots of cheese, spreads, and hummus that have no wheat or 小麦粉 (I don't check other ingredients). I also usually get my olives and saurkreut here. \n3. THAT SUSHI SHOP. I always go here but I don't know the name. I've done 100-yen sushis, Tsukiji sushis, and \"it's a date so let's spend sushi\" but this shop has really good and fresh stuff. They assemble the negitamago don freshly, as well as the tuna bowls. They have sashimi and rice sold separately, too. I can speak Japanese, but I bet with an allergy card or a Google translate that requests no soy sauce, etc., extra GF sensitivities can be accommodated. It's an unassuming shop beside a pork cutlet shop, in the hallways connecting Bio-ral and Jupiter. \n4. DOURAKU, GYUKAKU, and a few yakiniku shops right outside the Ofuna train station. You grill your own meat here. So with allergy cards, they could serve you raw meat for grilling. \n5. STARBUCKS in Grandship Mall has the Rice flour Matcha Cake and choco muffin.\n6. サロン ド テ クチユール マミーフレーズ ブノワトン ジャポン\nSalon de The Couture Mommy Fraise Benoitton Japon. Hidden gem. 10 minutes walk from the station. Does not easily come up on Google Search as name is not in English. \nJapanese thick pancakes, galettes, cakes, tea. YUM. \nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/JVu1JA7usLqHBM8i6 \n7. MILLOW KITCHEN Yokodai. It's 3 train stops from Ofuna (about 15 minutes), but worth it if you want a good meal. Not a dedicated GF facility, but very GF knowledgeable. Fryer and soy sauce are GF. They have good vegan options, too.\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/5cV4u5N3Y2Xumrn29\n8. SEIYU OFUNA (5 minutes from the Station). I buy gluten free rice flour canelle mix here for cheap (sold with the pancake or cake mixes). They have lots of fresh sashimi, lots of fresh fruits, veggies, nuts, chocolate, ice cream, etc. Very cheap compared to Tokyu Supermarkets and Seijo Ishii. If I'm in the area, I usually get my food for the week ingredients here. I haven't checked lately, but they should usually have Tamari soy sauce. \n9. DON QUIJOTE (across Seiyu). Not necessarily a GF place, but if you're grocery shopping and you have company that needs amusement, THIS.\n10. DAIKOKU DRUG STORE OFUNA (corner shop fronting the Kasama Exit side). Not a GF place, but another place for souvenirs and Japanese health and beauty stuff for cheap. Lotions, makeup, serums, creams, shampoo, cheap chocolate and snacks for giveways.I usually buy my collagen and facial moisturizing masks here. \n\nI have other reasons, but I was supposed to be editing an academic paper today🙉 not writing one, so I'll stop. 😅 Let me just say if you're #Yokosuka or #Kamakura bound, Ofuna is worth a stop over. ❤️",

Not only did I get to enjoy a top-class 9-course meal including several different cuts/styles of wagyu beef, a half a grilled lobster, grilled scallops and vegetables, and two delicious soups (a Dutch-style creamed onion and a Japanese-style cockles with seaweed in broth),   but I also got to watch the colourful night-time illuminations overlooking the huge, Dutch-themed park (this hotel is actually designed to resemble Amsterdam's Centraal Station). Including a glass of superior plum wine on ice, the bill came to just over £100, but it was totally worth it just to watch the very exacting care the chef took to clean the grill surfaces thoroughly and then prepare my GF beef + garlic fried rice seasoned simply with olive oil, salt, pepper and butter.

Also I didn’t see the cross contamination warning the first few times I ate these lol). There’s also Seijo Ishii at both Wakoshi and Narimasu stations if you have cooking facilities - they have pasta, bread, etc. The supermarkets in the area don’t have much that’s GF except ice cream and some puddings. I also did a lot of shopping in Ikebukuro because I found they had a lot of international foods.\n\nI think there’s a Coco curry place near the train station, but I didn’t visit. \n\nI had a kitchen and basically cooked, ate Muji curry or conbini onigiri, or I took the train into Tokyo. Shinbusakiya can be reached in about 40 mins if you take the fast train, which is why it was my go-to.\n\nHope this helps!!\n\nPS: if you’re in Wakoshi for RIKEN please please keep in mind that the rice in the cafeteria contains barley!",

    "Title": "I went to Tokyo, Hakone, and Kyoto in November of last year and had a great time! I'm celiac and was very worried about traveling safely. My research and this group really helped me. I bookmarked all the restaurants listed in this group that are GF. I saw that at least five were in the Roppongi area, so I booked a hotel in Roppongi (APA Hotel Roppongi Ekimae). I figured if I had to eat at those five places, I could simply rotate. These places were:\n* Gluten Free Ts (yummy dumplings)\n* Otsuna Sushi (omg so good)\n* Lobelisk (upscale and unique)\n* NachuRa Gluten Free cafe (love the sweets)\n* Cafe Komaya (cute spot)\n\nThings nearby that I wasn't able to try but noted bc of gluten-free options:\n* Freeze and Sleep Glue 10 Free \n* Jomon Roppongi \n\nI had yogurt and fruit in the morning and had the salmon and salt onigiri from 7-11 with my own tamari packets that I brought for lunch. I had almond packs for snacks. \n\nNot in the Roppongi area, but I loved eating at:\n* Gluten-free Kushiage Su (incredible, worth it) \n* Rizlabo (the pancakes are to die for, so unique)\n* Gonpachi (very knowledgeable, so tasty) \n\nIn Kyoto, I ate at Engine Ramen and there was a place in the market that had GF Matcha Cake (forget the name). Also got plain sashimi and shio style skewers at the market. \n\nHakone was the one place I struggled with food. The onigiri was sold out and most places couldn't accomodate me. I was able to eat Box Burger with lettuce instead of bread. I knew I was risking cross-contamination but they assured me they would clean it as best as possible and I didn't have a reaction. \n\nAnyway, I had a fantastic time and didn't get sick. Having a translation card, tamari packets, and almonds really helped. I relied heavily on onigiri and yogurt and stayed near places I had researched ahead of time. \n\nIt sucks that we can't be spontaneous anymore but planning like this really helped me enjoy my trip. Sorry if this is redundant with some other posts, but wanted to share my experience. I had the trip of a lifetime in Japan and am so glad I went. #Tokyo #Hakone #Kyoto",

Great fun for the kids though. In Shinjuku we booked on an app and there was much less of a wait. The allergen menu is online and I used my own soy sauce. \n\n**Soranoiro Nippon** at Tokyo Station. This was really good. Got there around 11.30am and had to queue a bit so careful if you plan to go for lunch and you have a train to catch. The place is small so you have to wait for one in one out tables. \n\n**Gluten Free Ts** - grateful to have a place where I could eat everything we all ordered but the food was just 'ok'. \n\n**Genuine Where Is a Dog**. Yes, you have to find the dog! This is a lovely place where the 2 owners work really hard to get all the food out to everyone, be patient. After eating a lot of seafood it was lovely to eat salad and humous and soup. Lovely fresh rice bread and I bought baked goods to have the next day too. \n\n**Rice Hack. **Yes, very delicious and fresh, as others have said. \n\n**Riz Labo. **We got there 15 mins before it opened and there was a queue behind us soon after. These were great and light as air - not super filling. \n\n**Otsuna Sushi.** These guys were really great when we had to leave our course menu half way through (my daughter wasn't feeling well). Thank you Otsuna. \n\n**The Knot** - this was a hotel and there was salad (own dressing) and fruit I could eat at the breakfast buffet. There are probably better hotels for GF though. \n\n**JR Kyushu Blossom hotel**. This was great location but really not much to eat for breakfast. \n\nKyoto - \n\n**Waco crepes. **I was nervous about the oats but actually I was fine and the crepes were delicious. Factor in a queue. \n\n**Gion Soy Milk Ramen**. Also factor in a queue. Hot tip if you are a group of 4 to list yourself as 2x 2 and sit separately. Food presented beautifully and large filling portions. Impressed with the noodles - so bouncy!\n\n**Engine Ramen. **Got there at 4.30 for 5 and already people queuing. But a big restaurant so we all got a table when they opened. Again, good bouncy noodles. \n\n**Sugarhill. **I got glutened here, possibly my fault as I totally relaxed when the server took our order and asked if there were any allergies up front. I ordered a ginger and lime soda which could have been the culprit. I was also suspicious of the Japanese mustard which came on the plate of my gluten free chicken dish. \n\nOsaka - \n\n**Comeconoco**. They had sold out of sandwiches by the time we got there, so we had cake for lunch. The cream puff - possibly best thing I have ever put in my mouth! \n\nTakayama - \n\n**Heinraku**. Just a totally delightful experience from start to finish. A cosy and homely place with lovely owners and good home cooked food. Come with an empty belly. \n\n**Fukyuan. **Another cute and homely place with a lovely courtyard to look out onto. GF fluffy pancakes but what I liked the most was the warabimochi with soybean powder (although maybe not to everyone's taste). \n\n**Wanosato. **This was a totally amazing ryokan experience. Unfortunately I think I got slightly glutened here but they really tried their best and I can only thank them for that. What really stuffed me up was the 2 x onigiris that I followed up with on the train back. I had been sticking to the 7-11 red salmon and salt but - as seen in posts on here - they appear to have changed their recipe halfway through my trip! Face palm emoji x 100!!\n\nThis was my 3rd time in Japan but my first since coeliac and even though I did get sick, I still want to come back again. All the GF places were highly popular so hopefully they will spread as a good business opportunity.",

    "Title": "My turn to give back to this group that helped me so much! Here it goes:\n\nOsaka:\n\n1. Gengi-soba. They serve GF ramen and GF tempura! Good understanding of celiac.\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/PVU8SFH74Ebhiu4Y6?g_st=ic\n\n2. Matsusakagyu Yakiniku M Dotombori Sennichimae Branch. It’s a hot pot on a grill. The entire family loved it and they have GF soy sauce.\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/36gSh9bMjGc9RDfa9?g_st=ic\n\n3. Gluten Free Cafe & Shisha Bar Anosaki Konosaki. It was an ok place. It wasn’t a very popular place for the family but good if you’re looking for something in the area. I completely forgot to take any pictures! 🤦🏻‍♀️\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/8jcgUu1jxXbfxo6S9?g_st=ic\n\n4. Comeconoco Gluten Free Cafe. The cakes here are to die for!!! Amazing desserts and they have lunch boxes that include salad, scones and a sandwich. Loved it all!\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/Bd6iS5Yd2om5UagW6?g_st=ic\n\n5. Hard Rock Cafe, Citywalk Universal. It’s Hard Rock Cafe so they’re knowledgeable about allergies.\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/9cLJRYPPrJu7gnLP9?g_st=ic\n\n6. Otis! This is a tiny little shop in Hiroshima where we went for a day trip. Amazing food and great value for your money! The owner is a sweet old man that understood cross contamination and kept us at ease! We had a reservation for 1pm on a Monday but there was only one more party there when we walked in.\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/8aCVEtWLQnRMpfxb9?g_st=ic\n\n7. Throughout all of Osaka, we ate mochis, candied fruit and on occasion, fresh grilled beef and seafood from street vendors after talking via google translate and ensuring it would be safe.\n\nKyoto:\n\n1. Sugarhill Kyoto. Best chicken teriyaki I’ve had and great knowledge of celiac and cross contact. Resos highly recommended. [@sugarhillkyoto](https://www.instagram.com/sugarhillkyoto/)\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZbwQibskEGC6HLYC6?g_st=ic\n\n2. Café & bar Maru Gluten Free. 100% GF and best service! Resos highly recommended. [@gluten_free_kyoto8](https://www.instagram.com/gluten_free_kyoto8/)\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/ct1Q8AiPNGSM91WP8?g_st=ic\n\n3. Ginsui. If you’re picking only one place in Kyoto, make it this one! It’s an experience! Must make reservations. [@ginsui1937](https://www.instagram.com/ginsui1937/)\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/uCCeEhTtayXDJDn39?g_st=ic\n\n4. Waco Crepes. I still dream about the ham and cheese crepes. If you’re not a sweet tooth, skip the whipped cream crepes. Check their IG and go as soon as they open as they run out early. [@wacocrepes](https://www.instagram.com/wacocrepes/)\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/ejKA71HskMZ8Psme8?g_st=ic\n\n5. Kikyo Sushi. If you’re into sushi and raw fish, this is the place for you. They even have GF soy sauce and understand cross contamination. Resos highly recommended.\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/MfJjihYCjkghRqaY7?g_st=ic\n\n6. Throughout all of Kyoto, we ate mochis, candied fruit and on occasion, fresh grilled beef and seafood from street vendors after showing my GF card talking via google translate and ensuring it would be safe.\n\nTokyo:\n\n1. Gluten-free T’s kitchen (Roppongi location). Amazing amazing amazing! 100% GF. Resos recommended.\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/HBfswRcVCbq94PBV9?g_st=ic\n\n2. Gluten-free T’s kitchen (Ueno location). Amazing again! 100% GF! We walked in and got a table right away.\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/NA31M2LqA1xzG1Lo8?g_st=ic\n\n3. Carniceria Meat Shop Grill & Wine. We stumbled across this while walking and used my GF card and google translate. It’s in the basement of Parco building. Food was great!\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/oivhqvmUNXAkBKgGA?g_st=ic\n\n4. Un-Gluten. This is a 100% GF pasta place. The food was absolutely delicious!\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/5zsS3hRmrQizrvUY9?g_st=ic\n\n5. Kuroboshi Sweets Asakusa. This place is a gem and they have the most delicious GF churros!!!\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZZjzUAC8gehK5q3R8?g_st=ic\n\n6. Shark Coffee in Shibuya. Delicious GF pastries. We stocked up for breakfast at the Airbnb.\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/9J84AEfSksqr7yBW6?g_st=ic\n\n7. Mo’s burger is a godsend! They have GF burger and hot dog in their kids menu. They’re small so we ordered 2-3 each person.\n\n8. Yakiniku restaurants are a safe bet! We walked into quite a few and I showed them my GF card and they’d just give me plain beef with salt. Delicious!!!\n\n9. Like in Osaka and Kyoto, mochi places are everywhere in all 3 cities. Mochis are naturally gluten-free as they’re made with rice flour.\n\n10. There were a lot of places I didn’t get to try for myself, unfortunately. Their locations below:\n\nRizlabo. 100% GF pancakes:\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/XJi4b91WCvuzvo7H9?g_st=ic\n\nRicehack. 100% GF bakery:\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/2bNYZDqDUXwceUvi9?g_st=ic\n\nGluten Free Kushiage Su. 100% GF skewers. Amazing reviews and reso required:\n📍 https://maps.app.goo.gl/HC8EtxUF7quq4QoW7?g_st=ic\n\nAnd that’s a wrap! A GF card in Japanese is highly recommended.\n\nFor anyone interested, I have an IG page where I post pictures of safe places to eat around the world with pictures. The above places are all marked with pictures there. The handle is @celia.theceliac.\n\nHonestly, I did not find Japan as hard as I thought it would be. It just takes a little patience, a GF card in Japanese and loooooots of planning. Good luck to all of you!\n\nSome pictures below with the name of the restaurant in the caption for each of them.\n\n#osaka #kyoto #tokyo #celiac #glutenfree",

    "Title": "We just got back from our trip and I’d like to thank everyone in this group for their recommendations. \n\nOur 16yrs old was diagnosed with coeliac disease a few months before we went to Japan, and I was so stressed about what she was going to be able to eat, and if we would be able to eat at restaurants and keep her safe. \n\nOur accommodation wasn’t self-catering and as we were going in peak Sakura season I couldn’t find anywhere else suitable, plus we didn’t really want to have to cook.\n\nSo finding this Group was fantastic, plus some websites such as Endless Distances, Legal Nomads, plus many others. \n\nWe had a GF Japanese translation card and used Google Translate to also communicate with staff.\n\nShe had great GF meals on ANA flights - booked in advance.\n\nIn Tokyo we stayed at Asakusa Tobu hotel which was so convenient for transport as 5mins walk to two subway lines so we could easily get around. \n\nIn Tokyo we ate at the following:\n- Gonpachi Asakusa twice (reservation in advance). They had a separate GF menu and my daughter loved the GF tempura, they gave her separate GF soy sauce, she also had wagyu steak, yakitori, sushi. It was all delicious, service was rather slow and not the friendliest of staff, but great for the food. This was the only place we had issues with service and unfriendly staff - everywhere else the staff were great.\n- Kuroboshi Churros in Asakusa for GF churros which were wonderful.\n- Otaco in Asakusa for chiffon cake - the lightest most amazing cake we have ever had - we tried the chocolate and also the lemon.\n- Rizlabo in in Harajuku/Omotesando. GF Souffle (fluffy) pancakes were incredible. They don’t do them every day, some days are GF crepes so check before you go if you particularly want souffle pancakes. You can’t book so arrive before they open. We arrived at 11.45am for 12pm opening. \n- RiceHack GF bakery in Harajuku/Omotesando - incredible baguettes, rolls, chocolate muffins - get there when they open to have a good choice as it’s a very small bakery. They were doing sausage rolls later in the day which I’ve heard are great. We went twice as it was so good, and lovely for us all to be able to eat the same thing.\n- Gluten Free T’s in Roppongi - all GF food. (reserved in advance). We had delicious fried chicken, spring rolls, gyozas. They have now opened another restaurant in the APA hotel Ueno Hirokoji in Akihabara, we didn’t have time to go there unfortunately.\n- Cafe Komoya in Roppongi - all GF food, salads, sandwiches, cake, curry and rice. The lady spoke fluent English and we discovered that they have a sister cafe in Kyoto where we also went (Koma Gallery Cafe). (reserved in advance but wasn’t busy).\n- Soranoiro Nippon Ramen Tokyo Station - fabulous ramen with GF option. Go early otherwise you’ll have a long wait. \n- Teppan Baby in Shinjuku for okonomiyaki - (reserved in advance). We were concerned that on the menu it said they cooked on the same grill, however after speaking to the staff they assured us it was cooked on a separate grill. Great fun restaurant and staff were friendly and helpful. \n- Torikizoku Asakusa - we were the only Westerners here and loved the Japanese atmosphere. (reserved in advance). Yakitori skewers with GF options. We then did karaoke just down the road which was fun. \n\nIn Kyoto we stayed at Hotel Vischio Granvia just south of Kyoto station. Great location as near Shinkansen, subway, trains and buses.\n\nIn Kyoto we ate at the following:\n- Kyoto Engine Ramen - great ramen with GF option. (reserved in advance).\n- Toshoan cafe - completely GF, amazing souffle (fluffy) pancakes. Takes 30mins to make the pancakes but worth the wait.\n- Cafe and Bar Maru - (reserved in advance). Quite expensive but very good, and all GF. \n- Kikyo Sushi - (reserved in advance). Amazing sushi with GF options. Family run, and the owner’s son Mitsuru speaks fluent English and can advise on GF options. Fabulous meal. \n- Sugarhill - (reserved in advance by Messenger). We went twice as it was so good, GF options. The chicken teriyaki was incredible - both the GF and standard versions. Also had Wagyu beef which was great. \n- Koma Gallery Cafe - GF, limited menu but nice food. \n- Breizh Cafe Creperie - GF options, they can change standard crepes for buckwheat galettes - you wouldn’t know the difference and they were delicious.\n\nIn Miyajima we went to Miyajima Base and had GF fries chicken which was delicious. \n\nAt Tokyo Haneda airport Terminal 2 our only option was Healthy Tokyo Cafe for GF vegan lasagne which was fine and served its purpose. Daughter didn’t realise it was vegan and thought she was eating meat so you wouldn’t know the difference. \n\nSo having been so worried beforehand, all the advance planning and using this group paid off and made the holiday fabulous and worry-free.",

    "Title": "Hi everyone! We have loads of new members, so I thought I would post about what it's really like to eat a gluten-free diet in Japan, sort of an introductory guide. Many Westerners come here and are shocked by and unprepared for the differences between their home country and Japan. I would like to welcome other residents of Japan to comment any of their advice as well. \nFirst, labelling laws are different here. For example, there is a product called mizuame that is a sweet syrup that is sometimes made from corn, sometimes from potatoes, and sometimes from barley, and companies do not have to list the source. Google labelling laws and get educated before coming. It is not like many Western countries where if the label says gluten-free, that means it's 100% safe from cross-contamination. At best, that means it has no gluten-containing ingredients. \nFood allergy knowledge can be very limited here. Some Japanese people you talk to for ordering food won't know the word for barley, I know that sounds bizarre, but they sort of group grains into one category in their minds. I have told many people that my daughter is allergic to Ko-mugi and O-mugi (wheat and barley) and gotten asked what O-mugi is. Like Westerners, many Japanese people don't know soy sauce contains wheat. We went to a restaurant that advertised itself as gluten-free once, and they used regular soy sauce. (Yes, I know about the argument of less than 20ppm, let's save that for another day). \nWealthy travelers who stay in expensive hotels or eat at fine dining restaurants in urban centers will have an easier time eating gluten-free in Japan as those hotels' and restaurants' staff members are trained in catering to foreign guests with food allergies. These members of this group will often comment on posts about what an easy time they had eating gluten-free in Japan. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you're more a budget traveler (or resident, like me), be aware of that discrepancy in the posts on this group. \nDon't plan on walking into any restaurant you find and expect to be able to eat there. Restaurants in Japan are allowed to refuse you service. If you come in with a card, it is possible that you will be turned away. \nRestaurants in Japan usually serve set meals. If you ask to change anything about the set meal (unless you're in a fine-dining establishment that caters to foreigners) you will likely be met with shock and panic, and they often say no. If you explain you have an allergy, I have found that about 1 out of 5 times, some kind soul will help you out, but only in mom-and-pop shops, not chains.  \nSometimes translation apps translate a label badly because it's on a rounded containers. Double and triple check! \nDon't despair, it is possible to eat gluten-free in Japan. I have lived here for 5 years with a Celiac kid and she's thriving. You just need to do loads of research and be prepared. Have a map of safe restaurants in the areas you will be visiting. Save pictures of safe foods from combinis. Find natural grocers. Learn the kanji for gluten-containing ingredients.  Read lots of articles online. Good luck and enjoy Japan!",

    "Title": "Just wanted to give a heads up if staying in Kanazawa... The gf place \"Love for All\" was the worst gf place we've ever been to. Very overpriced and we were amazed how subpar the taste was :/. And very unnecessarily small portion sizes. I have never had such a bad experience at a gf place or felt so ripped off, and I've been to quite a few gf places in Japan now. You'd be better off just grabbing a steak/veggies at the omicho market ten minutes away and cooking yourself ($20 for an a5 wagyu.. we had about half each so still less than we had spent at Love for All). \n\nGonna leave my first bad review for this place, I had read the reviews before going but didn't see all the one star reviews...",

        "Message": "Kanazawa resident and I second this. I’ve only been once and was really disappointed with the service (the staff was really unfriendly) along with the high prices and subpar taste. Even the prices for the GF items for sale were way overpriced.\n\nOmicho Market is good option if you’re staying in a place with a kitchen, but if not, Aarshirwad is a Michelin star rated Indian restaurant that’s right down the road from Love for All. It’s not dedicated gluten free, but I’ve had good experiences there. It’s not cheap, but it’s not overpriced, some of the staff speak English, and they have some gluten free items on the menu. I’m gluten intolerant and don’t have too many issues with cross-contamination, so if that’s not as much of a problem for you then I recommend it. They also do take out if you’d rather eat in your accommodations. \n\nThis option is a bit farther away (it’s right across the street from Curio, near the station), but Midoriya is a cafe with gluten free and vegan options. It’s a store as well, and they had a decent amount of gluten free items for sale (pasta, etc). I haven’t eaten the food there myself so I can’t vouch for it, but it looked promising. \n\nIf you prefer cooking, most AEON supermarkets sell gluten free and allergen-friendly products. Osakaya sells gluten free soy sauce, but that’s all I’ve seen there. AL Plaza in Kanazawa has great allergen-friendly options. They even sell frozen takoyaki, which are alright. If you go to the supermarket in AL Plaza, there’s two allergen-friendly sections: one is the health section (it’ll have green labels that say 健康サポート (kenkou sapooto, health support), and the other is in the baby food section. The best part about the AL Plaza supermarket is that they sell GF/allergen-friendly dashi, mentsuyu, and ponzu. I haven’t been able to find these in any other store, just online. Do be aware that the dashi sells out fast if you go to the store. \n\nSorry this is so long, and Charlotte Jessop I’m really sorry you had such a terrible experience at Love for All 😞 You’re not alone on that front. I hope these recommendations help for anyone else traveling in Kanazawa and Ishikawa! \n(Google pins posted in the replies)",

For those of you who are severe coeliacs this app takes the hard work out. \nSo please consider downloading it (the free version is enough for me although there is a premium version if you want) and then contributing those wonderful rare finds from your travels.

Not helped by my wife being vegan and having two kids as well.  Thankfully, my short term symptoms are mild so I have just given up and decided to just not let the search for food consume me or our holiday.  I haven’t gone overboard (no pizzas, noodles or bread) but I have let the regime slide.  Plenty of green tea will help my gut, and the knowledge that in just over a week I will go back to my new normal.  I figure I managed nearly 45 years before being diagnosed.  A couple of weeks is hardly going to be the be all and end all.",

Having said that, let me give you some tips to make your life easier:\n- breakfast is onigiri rice balls from family mart or pancakes at home. I brought a package of GF pancake mix and we have it every other day. My son and myself are the celiacs in the family. \n- I plan my itinerary around places to eat that I found in this group or on “find me GF”. Yes, I know it takes away spontaneity but unfortunately spontaneity went out the window as soon as we got our diagnosis.\n- your wife being vegan works in your favour as most places that cater to GF also caters to vegan so do a quick google search in the area you’re in and you might be surprised.\n- I have an IG page (@celia.theceliac) where I am making stories and putting them as highlights for every city I’m going to. I went to Osaka and now we’re in Kyoto. You might find something there but I do suggest you message them ahead of time and explain the gluten-free situation. All places ive been to this far already understood what I was talking about when I mentioned gluten-free or celiac because they have received several similar requests. \n- don’t hesitate to educate people. Just this afternoon near the bamboo grove, my husband found a fresh seafood grill place and showed them the GF card. Initially, they were going to turn us away but I saw that they were not putting any sauces on the grill and it was just meat and other seafood so I explained to them that if they were that afraid, they could just put a fresh sheet of aluminum over the grill and use a new utensil for cooking it and after much back and forth, they obliged. This was the second time at a street stand that I’ve been able to get delicious Kobe beef on a stick. My first time was by Osaka Castle. I know it’s a pain but use google translator and ask specific questions like: “can you please tell me what ingredients are in this (blank)?”, “does it have any soy sauce?” “Do you cook anything else with soy sauce on the same surface?” “Can I please kindly ask you to use a clean utensil as I have a severe allergy? It won’t give me an anaphylactic reaction but I’ll be throwing my guts up later.”  9 times out of 10 that I tried that, people understood and obliged.\n\nI’m so sorry you’re going through this and I hope your trip gets better!",

They appear to have a main bakery too but I only went to their small take out facility. They use dairy and almonds, with rice flour  and almond as the base for their treats. \n\nThey were having a strawberry fair and I started by ordering the two parfaits they offered- one pudding flavored and the other strawberry. (We shared between four people.) They were good but reaction was mixed in our group. I liked the pudding flavored one but was the only one... it had interesting texture in the ice cream/pudding blocks that was somehow icy and chewy at the same time. However I was a bit disappointed the sauce tasted a bit underwhelming and there were no fresh fruit that would have elevated it. \n\nI also tried their take-away omiyage donut. It tasted reassuringly of rice flour but I wouldn't buy it again.\n\nMy daughter and I decided to have a cake party on the shinkansen because I wanted to try the strawberry tart. It was nice with a custard filling and real strawberries. We also tried a multi-layered strawberry dome that had a softer shell than we expected but had an amazing lychee strawberry filling. Last we tried their cake with strawberry jam and accents of strawberry. Their fancy desserts were not only the most beautiful but the most delicious. \n\nThis is a really good fancy gf bakery, and once you know where it is you can grab an order and take it easily on the shinkansen. They are all sweet items, no savory, but very well done. \n\n#kyushuu #dedicatedglutenfree #glutenfreecake #kagoshimachuostation\n\n https://maps.app.goo.gl/sWEC3tcTzm74TVmu8",

    "Title": "Ciao a tutti, here is my little contribution to this group that has been of great great help during my 2 week holidays in Japan!\n\nI  had wonderful ramens in Tokyo Station and at Engine Ramen in Kyoto,  churros in Asakusa, tempura at T's Kitchen, okonomiyaki at Chibo  Dotonbori Osaka, crepes at Wacos Crepes, pancakes at Rizlabo, fried  chicken at Miyajima Base, hotdog at Mos Burger and a lot of onigiris for lunch and GF Kirin beer for aperitivo. I was so happy to be  able to try all these new tastes, so here are my few discoveries:\n\n1) [https://www.yakatabune-tsurishin.com/en/index.html](https://www.yakatabune-tsurishin.com/en/index.html)\n\nl  managed to have a very nice typical dinner while cruising Sumida river in #Tokyo on a traditional boat. A Japanese friend called in advance to ask for  gluten free options and l had miso soup, tempura, sashimi, fruits and  drinks. A little pricey (abt 70 Euros) but worth it. \n\n2) [https://miyajima-kikunoya.com/en/](https://miyajima-kikunoya.com/en/)\n\nI  stayed one night in #Miyajima (totally recommended to avoid the crowds)  and l had a full japanese GF breakfast. They seem to understand  perfectly what gluten is and the cook came also to double check  everything with me. l gave her my restaurant card, hoping it will help  others. \n\n3) http://www.lifecorp.jp/store/bio-ral/\nAt Namba Station in #Osaka there's a Bio Ral shop, for the first time l found GF bread, pasta and cakes.\n\nHope you will have a wonderful trip, if you need any help, don't hesitate to ask. \n\nThanks again for all the useful tips l read in this group, you literally made my journey much easier than l could ever hope. \n\nSilvia",

Soba is almost always not 100% buckwheat and not gluten free. There may be one restaurant that can do g/f gyoza but I don’t think it’s vegetarian (gluten free t’s). Plain rice will be fine.

There was surprisingly a lot of allergy information on their website. I’ve included screen shots of restaurants with low allergen meals, GF popcorn and GF turkey leg. \n\nFirst picture is matcha white chocolate popcorn (stand located outside of cafe ollins) with the rum coffee from cafe ollins. It was a hot day and the rum coffee drink is served hot. I asked for ice on the side and they gave it to me. \nNext are Mickey ice pops. They are tropical flavored and hit the spot! Not all wagon locations have both Mickey and Minnie ice pops so if you’re looking for a specific flavor definitely check the menu before getting in line. \nFor lunch we went to hungry bear cafe and I got the low allergen vegetable curry with tandoori chicken. At the register I said I have an allergy and the lady got on a Walkie-Talkie and a dude with an iPad came out so I could pick my allergy and then my meal. Super quick! Once chosen I paid and received food in like 10 minutes. Before we left the park we got a turkey leg at cowboy cook house! \n\nLastly there is an area connected to Disneyland by the Disney monorail called #IKSPIARI. This place is like downtown disney and there are a lot of American restaurants here including TGIF, red lobster, Outback Steakhouse, and rainforest cafe. There is also the Australian restaurant Guzman y Gomez where everything if GF expect for the wheat wraps and churros. Their French fries are fried separately than their churros.",

Al mio arrivo avevano preparato tutte le mie cose a parte. \n- Atsushi a Kanazawa -> anche qui dopo aver prenotato online con la card della celiachia mi hanno preparato tutto separatamente. Il sushi normale che generalmente fanno contiene una piccola percentuale di aceto di grano ma se chiedete in anticipo di farlo solo con aceto di riso (ovviamente se le condizioni lo permettono) saranno così gentili da prepararlo apposta. Vi assicuro che è il miglior sushi mangiato in Giappone.\n- Fukyuan a Takayama -> fanno dei pancake molto buoni di solo riso quindi completamente senza glutine.",

    "Title": "Long post.\nI returned from a 16 days trip to Japan between February and March and I would like to thank this group so much, and share some information with you.\nThe celiac and lactose free person was a friend of mine, but I well know the problem having a celiac nephew and having various food intolerances (I did have a GF bar some years ago).\nI planned every part of the trip (flights, hotels, itinerary) trying to include GF places to eat whenever possible, and I must say that, for me, the best tricks for enjoying a GF Japan are two: planning and booking.\nSpeaking of planning: this group is a unique and unparalleled source of informations, so take advantage of it before you leave by using the lens of research, because it will allow you to have fantastic experiences.  The GF part was the last thing I had planned and even if I found her almost one place a day to have a decent meal, I could have done better with a few more days to spare.\nI used a lot 2 of the GF maps found on this group by Spenser Babb Biernacki  and @Katarinakokic showing the GF spots.\nWhenever we knew where to eat it was easy, and we found good food and nice people with knowledge of the problem.\nWhen there were no places marked on the map, or when the places were too far away from the area we were in the time we want to eat (considering that we were a group of 6, so we have also to mix the needs of different people) we had 2 choices: get food from combini or ask restaurants if there was any chance of having anything GF.\nCombini: I highly recommend to use the magnificient work done by a member of the group I’m not able to find the post anymore (so please excuse me if I cannot write your name, but I’m sure other members will help me find him/her again): it was a list called “Japan_Food products list” and there were hundreds of articles in the combini that in this group were identified as GF. If you can, print the list (even if there are many sheets), choose the food you might like, highlight it and try looking for it in the combini, or simply show the photo to the clerk. This will save you a lot of time in the combini store. Some combini have a special “Happy bakery” line which is gluten free and some lactose and egg free, so you can have bread to make sandwiches or for breakfast with jam.\nI also recommend visiting some big supermarket, although this doesn’t mean there are more options of GF because it depends on the brand of the market, but there are more options for vegetables, fresh fruit, dried fruit, ham, eggs, sashimi, mochi.\nThe main problem with food bought in combini is where to eat it: in Japan you cannot eat on the street or on the train, except Shinkansen. We were, as said, in the company of other people, so we tried going to the restaurants where the others would eat, asking if it was possible for the celiac person to eat her own food. I must say that for the most of the trip we found several places where this has been accepted without problems, but, especially in the last part of the trip, we found some places, especially small or crowded ones, that hasn’t allowed this to happen. We had respected that, because they are not obliged to do that and even in Italy (where I’m from) the most of the places do no accept people eating their own food in a restaurant.\nLanguage: English is not always well spoken, so sometimes it can be difficult to make yourself understood, but the translator helps a lot.\nGF Card: I didn’t use the GF cards I found on this group because, as someone else has already written, this will scare Japanese restaurateurs and you get a “no” as answer, because they prefer not to offer you a food that can make you sick. This has not to been taken as a bad thing, but, on the contrary, it’s a big form of respect, and once you will be in Japan you will understand that Japanese people love to help others in any way they can, so, please, do not get angry if someone will not accept to cook for you because it’s a form of respect towards you.\nWhen you enter a place not marked on the maps, you can ask if they have GF options, if they do not understand you can ask if they have anything cooked without flours and additional seasonings such as grilled meat or fish. If they don’t understand what you are asking for, it’s probably it’s best to change place because they do not know what contamination is. We tried to do this at one place, asking for plan cooked eggs with nothing else, but than my friend has contamination issues, so we never tried again.\nKindness: Japanese people are absolutely kind and respectful and this is also the way to relate to them. And if sometimes it could be difficult, it’s not their fault: celiac disease is something relatively new to them. In Italy we were like them about 15 years ago, so they will learn in the next few years and it will be better.\nBreakfast: almost no hotels offers GF breakfast and, especially for those who are used to eating sweet food (like Italians), consider to bring it from home. Even for non-celiacs the choice of sweet food (croissant, jam, etc.) is very limited, but we are in Japan, Asia, so we have to adapt to their way of having breakfast. They have vegetables (sometimes raw) and fruit, but most of the food is cooked, so not ok for contaminations even tough basically it is GF.\nAbout booking: we were in Japan at the end of the low season, we didn’t book any restaurants except one. We were lucky in most places, in GF places we wait sometimes up to 30 minutes, in Fuji area (after waiting 30 minutes to enter) we sit down and order, but after 2 other customers besides us, they put the “sold out” signal out! In Miyajima the place it was supposed to do GF, it doesn’t do it for lunch but only in the evening. In Shinjuku it was Sunday evening and without a reservation there was no place. In Takayama we have to book online, because they only accept reservations, as they cook for 2-4 customers every 30 minutes. If you go in high season you must book.\nIn summary: Japan is wonderful, not yet well prepared on GF it’s true, but if you plan, book, and have a great spirit of adaptation, if you bring some essential food from home and use all the tools that this group will give you, you will probably love it.\nIn the pictures there are name of the GF places we went in.",

This group has been great to gather info and start making lists. \n\nWill be visiting Tokyo (staying in Shiomi), Hakone (hotel does GF so okay there), Takayama, and Kyoto with a day trip to Hiroshima.",

Looking at the menu we saw three potential options- the curry/rice meal, the mango sundae and the mango lassie. We were right! The server checked the allergen list and all were safe for no wheat (minus the cookie on the sundae).

I’m bringing some breakfast things from home (pancake mix, oatmeal) but will need to use milk in Japan. Do they manage to put gluten in milk too or can I be confident that any milk is safe?\n\n3.

I am finally posting my list so far.  \n\n・The most convenient restaurant is at the Kumamoto train station in the Blossom Kumamoto hotel: #Senzanbansui (九州創作 千山万水) inside Forest Terrace Kumamoto. It is a new fancy place that has never been busy when we have been there. Great food, and they have been happy to make accommodations for my gluten intolerance and my wife’s dairy intolerance.\n\n[https://forestterrace-km.jp/restaurant/](https://forestterrace-km.jp/restaurant/)\n\n[https://maps.app.goo.gl/8ZQurU8BzybXT1Ui6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8ZQurU8BzybXT1Ui6)\n\n・Near the #KumamotoZoo is #Pho Time, a tiny Vietnamese Pho place we just discovered today. They are entirely gluten free, make tasty Pho, house-made sodas Ume, cola, ginger ale, etc. Pho Ga is ¥1000.\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/pho___time?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA%3D%3D](https://www.instagram.com/pho___time?igshid=OGQ5ZDc2ODk2ZA%3D%3D)\n\n[https://g.co/kgs/2DKgJMy](https://g.co/kgs/2DKgJMy)\n\n・There is a great GF bakery that makes great #Chiffon cake: Amam Komeko, a bit out of the way between Kumamoto city and the Kumamoto Aso Airport. Great GF chiffon cake. She uses mostly rice flour, olive oil, beet sugar, and soy milk. \n\n[https://www.instagram.com/amam.komeko?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==](https://www.instagram.com/amam.komeko?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw%3D%3D)\n\n[maps.app.goo.gl/7yVZKPA7yYnVRy4r9](http://maps.app.goo.gl/7yVZKPA7yYnVRy4r9)\n\n・There is also a small GF #donut shop pandatoneco also a bit out of the way and they close as soon as they run out of donuts, and they have limited hours. \n\n[https://www.instagram.com/pandatoneco?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==](https://www.instagram.com/pandatoneco?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw%3D%3D)\n\n[https://maps.app.goo.gl/tywnxuP4HhifqzU16](https://maps.app.goo.gl/tywnxuP4HhifqzU16)\n\n・There are also #yakiniku restaurants around where you can order plain meat and veggies to grill and salad bars. Avoid most dipping sauces, but some places may offer “Shio-dare”, salt based sauces.\n\n・There is #Aeon Mall where you can buy GF bread and rolls.\n\n[https://maps.app.goo.gl/FYxcp9hDnFovx8kW7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FYxcp9hDnFovx8kW7)\n\n・The #Starbucks currently have GF vegan chocolate muffins, and GF vegan matcha roll cake.\n\n・Most (not all) MOS burgers in Kumamoto sell the simple but edible non-allergen hot dogs and burgers made of pork with simple rice flour steam buns that they microwave to order. This has been one of our safe options when all else fails.\n\nHope that helps. Would love to hear from anyone else in Kumamoto who is avoiding gluten, though I feel like I know all 5 of us ;-)",

I did find on the last day steak potato and vegetable and the Hirafu gondola restaurant which was delicious - they reassured me only salt and pepper on the steak and nothing else. \nThree days I ate pot noodle from home I had brought with me and a brioche bun I also brought with me alongside some snacks like nuts and crisps from the supermarket. \nWe did CAT skiing one day and our tour company made me a delicious gluten free takeaway lunch with rice, mince tomatoes cheese etc. \n\nDinner \n\nWe ate at the following;\n\n#renkitchen gluten free menu - amazing izukaya experience, they told me everything is prepared in a separate area, I even checked the edamame beans were cooked in separate water. \n#tajmahal Indian restaurant - we ate here twice - the owner told me Japanese curries use flour to thicken but they used almond flour. It was delicious and cheap. The only thing is I think i saw them bbq’ing some of the chicken in the same oven and same preparation area as the nans so I would stick to curry’s that are prepared in the kitchen. \nThe #vale - (chips not GF) - gluten free burger - the bread was so delicious and staff were on it - they grilled the bread in a separate area to the other bread. \n#rpizza - GF pasta - they asked if I wanted the pasta cooked in separate water or not - which I said yes as I’m a coeliac. Pasta was absolutely delicious.  \n\nLet me know if any questions I’d be happy to help/answer!",

This is probably due to the hundreds of years of isolation (鎖国). \n\nThe other gene that causes celiac is common in Japanese people but gets activated less often than the main one.\n\nThere is probably a large amount of undiagnosed people in Japan. Even with an incidence of 1 in 10,000, thwt eoukd be about 13,000 in Japan.

There was also a calligraphy activity on several days.\n\n[https://mimaruhotels.com/en/hotel/suites-kyoto-shijo/](https://mimaruhotels.com/en/hotel/suites-kyoto-shijo/)\n\nFor restaurants - we stuck to the ones recommended in this group.

The staff seemed to understand about gluten and it is described on website.

However, it wasn’t busy. There are only a few GF items on menu but they are very diligent and understanding about allergies etc.\n\n#EngineRamen -  got there about 5:30 and got table straight away. When you order a GF dish, they give you a coaster when you order GF.\n\nphoto\n\nWe bought some cinnamon and macha yatsuhashi from #HonkeNishio atsuhashi in Arashiyama.

They will drop/pick up at supermarket, ski lift, rental, restaurant - very handy as Hakuba is quite large and spread out. And the in house onsen was great.\n\n[https://www.wadanoforestapartments.com/](https://www.wadanoforestapartments.com/)\n\nOur accommodation dropped us at the #ACoop supermarket several times during our stay. They pick you up 30 minutes later so it was a mad rush to buy ingredients for a few meals plus snacks and breakfast items. There’s only one coeliac in our family of 5 so we also needed lots of standard food. \n\nA-Coop is a big Japanese supermarket with not much international food. I couldn’t find tacos or corn chips. Following another post, I did find the gluten free section on the last trip but this section mainly had pancake mix, okonomiyaki mix and curries - nothing we needed. It's Aisle 17.\n\nOn mountain GF options are limited.\n\n#BearsCafeSakka in the Snow Plaza Sakka (Happo One) did chips in separate fryer and a vegan curry with rice. The staff were Australian so easy to confirm. My son did take a GluteGuard when eating the chips.[https://www.bearscafehakuba.com/sakka](https://www.bearscafehakuba.com/sakka)\n\nAt Iwatake, inside the mountaintop cafe restaurant “Sky Ark” we found #SoupStockTokyo. It was to the right with Hakuba Deli to the left as you enter the food service area. It had lobster bisque labelled as GF and Tokyo chicken curry gluten free by ingredient. The menu had a link to a website with the gluten free options. The staff didn't have the best English so we took a chance on cross contamination and had the soup/curry combo.\n\n[https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/sst-web-master/uploads/sst_gluten-free.pdf](https://s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/sst-web-master/uploads/sst_gluten-free.pdf)[https://iwatake-mountain-resort.com/winter/ss](https://iwatake-mountain-resort.com/winter/ss)\n\nThis place is a chain that I hadn't seen mentioned during my research.\n\nAll the on mountain eating places have free water but sometimes you need to ask.\n\nWe ate out 3 times for dinner. Prior to travel, I emailed Hakuba Hotel Group to ask about gluten free options.\n\n#RabbitHole in Wadano - did their El Chapo burger with lettuce instead of a bun and coleslaw instead of chips. Booked prior via Hakuba Hotel Group. \n\n[https://www.therabbitholex.com/locations/hakuba-japan](https://www.therabbitholex.com/locations/hakuba-japan)\n\n[https://hakubahotelgroup.com/winter/restaurants/tori-co/](https://hakubahotelgroup.com/winter/restaurants/tori-co/)\n\n#ToriCo. in Wadano - various yakitori were GF but not everything. You need to ask and they had to make some modifications and handled my sons order separately. There was no GF soy sauce so take some - I forgot. The wait staff were Australian so easy to discuss. Booked prior via Hakuba Hotel Group.\n\n[https://hakubahotelgroup.com/winter/restaurants/tori-co/](https://hakubahotelgroup.com/winter/restaurants/tori-co/)\n\n#MrMiyagi at Whitehorse Hotel in Echoland - majority of menu is GF.

    "Title": "**January Japan trip notes**\n\nThanks to this group for all your tips and information. \n\nOur family of 5 - husband, myself and our 3 boys (18, 16 and 13) - from Australia spent 18 days in Japan in January. Our 13 year old is coeliac and also allergic to peanuts. He wasn't ever unwell and found enough food - although was sick of salmon onigiri by the end of the trip. He did use a GluteGuard when we thought cross contamination might be an issue.\n\nWe stayed in apartments in Toyko, Hakuba and Kyoto and I will follow up with separate posts for each location.\n\nWe took the following food with us:\n* 3 loaves frozen GF bread - this was placed back into the freezer at each apartment\n* Toaster bags\n* 2 packets GF pasta\n* 2 boxes GF muesli bars, 2 packets Coles GF cake bars\n* GF cereal - Weetbix, GF Sultana Bran, Maple Crunch - this ran out on 2nd last day\n* Mighty mite, Laughing Cow cream cheese\n* 40 GF soy sauce fish purchased from Sushi Sushi, few Ketchup sachets from McDonalds\n* Chicken spice mix jar, taco spice mix sachets\n* Corn thins, rice crackers\n* Drinking chocolate\n* Rice flakes for porridge (didn’t use)\n* Tunas, Tuna and beans. Tuna rice crackers snack pack (small enough for plane)\n* 3 Noodle cups\n* Dried cranberries\n\nWe also took:\n* Normal muesli, muesli bars\n* Vegemite squeezy pack\n\nMy overarching advice is that don’t do Japan (or any trip) without self catering. It is so much easier and healthier to make your own breakfast, some dinners, some lunches and snacks. In some ways it was harder to feed the 16 year old who only eats quite plain food and nothing with a sauce. Therefore, the ability for him to fry some eggs or chicken was invaluable. It was easy to find bread, oatmeal and cornflakes for the non-coeliacs.\n\nNote that the kitchen sink won't have a plug (a Japanese thing according to the concierge!). Where we didn't have a dishwasher, we used an old bread bag to plug the drain.\n\nI found the following websites provided some invaluable gluten free advice:\n\n[https://www.tokyoweekender.com/food-and-drink/parents-guide-gluten-free-tokyo/](https://www.tokyoweekender.com/food-and-drink/parents-guide-gluten-free-tokyo/)\n\n[https://gfguidejapan.com/](https://gfguidejapan.com/)\n\n[https://fukuokaeats.com/eats/gluten-free-japan](https://fukuokaeats.com/eats/gluten-free-japan)\n\n[https://www.legalnomads.com/gluten-free/japan/?fbclid=IwAR27eOPC8XFDC_mz2qIc5XdeZC8rpyylWZ_UX0asIg6vHottp3nBSMJttZ0](https://www.legalnomads.com/gluten-free/japan/?fbclid=IwAR27eOPC8XFDC_mz2qIc5XdeZC8rpyylWZ_UX0asIg6vHottp3nBSMJttZ0)\n\nAnd this gave an overview of supermarket products:\n\n[https://www.simplyoishii.com/grocery-guide.html](https://www.simplyoishii.com/grocery-guide.html)\n\nIn addition, I followed this group for 6 months saving particular posts then used the search for specific locations, products, restaurants etc.\n\nI would also note that I printed cards from Coeliac Australia and made a list of words and kanji to look for on packaging but I didn’t really use either. We relied on Google Translate, English menus and English speaking staff - we were in very touristy areas.\n\nSome general advice - I couldn't have done without mobile data to access Google Maps, Google Translate and general searching. 4 of us had eSIMs (airalo) and one had a physical SIM (older phone). It was cheaper than a pocket wifi and allowed us to separate then contact each other via WhatsApp.\n\nWe purchased Pasmo Passports in Ikebukuro Station on our second day. Using an IC card was very convenient and I would definitely recommend this over tickets. We did have to ask 3 times where to go for the correct office within the station but everyone had a map to show us.\n\nAfter you plan your itinerary, double check the places will be open on the days you are planning to go and the closing time - we went to Tokyo Imperial Palace on a Friday when East Garden wasn't open and got to Tofukiji too late to entry the gardens.\n\nI was worried about not having enough food on the trip as we had to transit via Hong Kong (where there are no GF options) so took frozen cooked chicken and 10 x 100g yoghurts in our carry on. However, the plane food was enough and ended up throwing away the chicken and some yoghurts as we entered Japan. We hung onto the Tuna rice crackers snack pack in case of delay on the home trip but wasn't required.\n\nHave at least 20 minutes to transfer between trains a. We only had 10 min between express train and skinkansen  at Nagoya. Bit tight!\n\nFor sightseeing and other general advice, I borrowed guide books from the library and listened to most episodes of [https://www.facebook.com/SightseeingJapanPodcast](https://www.facebook.com/SightseeingJapanPodcast)",

    "Title": "Hi All! I went to Japan back in October and never posted about my favorite restaurants.  I am posting here about TOKYO specifically, and and a lot of these places came from suggestions on this group (thank you!) or were ones I found.  Lots of notes as I was writing this all up into an email for a friend. \n\nAlso a side note- I do NOT actually recommend using the Gluten Free Translation card.  I used it my first few days, and it generally sent the workers into a frenzy and they would be so worried they would make me sick and ended up just saying \"dont eat here\"- so I got better at explaining I cannot have wheat, soy sauce, etc, and asked if they could cook my food on a clean surface.  I stayed away from fried foods unless it was a totally GF place.  Japanese people are *SO NICE* and *POLITE*, that sometimes the GF card made the situation more dramatic than it needed to be.  Just my 2 cents, you do you.  \n\n**Convenience Store foods**- the convenience stores were generally my go to.  The common brands are 7/11, Family Mart, and Lawsons.  Lawsons and 7/11 were the best, FamilyMart was fine but not quite as much selection usually.  Here is a good blog post about GF foods you can find at most of those places. I am also attaching a picture of Onigiri- there are only certain ones that are GF tho (mentioned in the blog), so you just need to check.  I lived on these and the soft/hard-boiled eggs and presliced fruit. Also, if you happen to see the \"green tea cheesecake\" (its in like a little cup you eat with a spoon) from Lawson's, don't sleep on it. its real good! https://healthytokyo.com/blog/gluten-free-food-in-japanese-convenience-stores/\n\n**Restaurants**- These were some in particular in Tokyo I had a good meal/success at.  Sushi is kind of hard, they sometimes brush the soy sauce onto the sushi in advance, so you just have to explain to them no sauce when you arrive, and I brought my own tamari and showed them I had my own sauce.  I still took gluten-ease pills at places I was not entirely sure about in case there was some gluten in the rice vinegar or they had possibly marinated the sushi. \n# Shimbu Sakiya Ramen- Shibuya. Several GF options, even GF fried chicken and gf/vegan pot stickers.  I went here twice, it was really good.\n\nGluten Free T's- Roppongi, this was definitely mostly \"western\" people dining, but the food was good.  I went here twice as well. \n# NO MEAT, NO LIFE. 5go.- Shinjuku, Yakiniku restaurant (you grill the meat yourself, and it is really good) This was another place I just brought my own tamari and it was totally fine. I just had meat and salad, but could have also gotten some rice. I think any Yakiniku restaurant could accommodate GF since its mainly just meat.  Just need to make sure it is not pre-marinated.  The beef in Japan is incredible quality, I really highly recommend at least trying one meal like this.\n# Mimasu- Shinjuku. Sushi, was good, they were out of a lot of fish when I was there but it was overall good.  (you have to try Toro- fatty tuna!). the owners were very old but were fine with me showing them my questions on my phone. This was the one place I felt like GF was not fully understood so I just watched a little more carefully when they were preparing my food. This came up on a GF google maps search and others said they \"were great and totally understood GF and accommodated\" but I did not feel that was the case personally.\n# Soranoiro NIPPON- Ramen in Tokyo Station (Ginza), you have to exit the actual train part of the station (but stay in the station...) and put your bag in a locker, the restaurant is very small, and it was a bit hard to find. I looked at the google photos of what the outside of the restaurant looked like.  I wish I could tell you exactly how to get there, but it was sort of under a staircase... there are a ton ton ton of restaurants in Tokyo station, but this was my first meal after flying into Japan and it was good. It was not anything fancy but again, good.\n# Gluten Free Kushiage Su- Ginza- this place was really special.  It was a 10 or 13 course meal and it was all small bites on skewers.  It was honestly so good and unique, and only 8 seats in the whole place.  You need to make a reservation, and it was the most expensive meal I had there, but it was honestly worth it.  Highly recommend if you are a foodie and want a unique experience.  Everything on the menu is GF!\n\nWe also went to a \"teppanyaki\" restaurant, but I do not remember the name.  you could *try* for this style of cuisine (it is \"hibachi\", which is not the correct term for it but what we call it in the US), they just cooked my portion first without any sauces etc. It was a little more complicated to explain GF, but if you end up at a place like that with your friends I think you will manage.\n\nFor breakfast, I usually just had 7/11 stuff.  I am weird tho and can eat savory for breakfast.\n\nDid not make it to, but wanted to (they were either closed or it was not convenient for me)\n# Cafe Komaya Roppngi- someone at Gluten free t's suggested this place\n\nThere were honestly quite a few places I tagged on google maps that had GF in the reviews or came up for some reason, so I am sure you will find something where you are, there are a lot more I could list here but were just ones I found on a search, so not sure how legit they were.\n\n**Bars (just for fun!)**\n# Aoyama Tunnel- if you go here make sure you check out both floors, It is really small but a really cool spot. Maybe my favorite bar I have ever been to.\n# DJ BAR Bridge SHINJUKU- another fun bar. you have to take the outside elevator to it. you will see what I mean if you go there.\n\n#tokyo #conveniencestore #ramen #yakiniku #Sushi #glutenfree #Shinjuku #ginza #shibuya #roppongi",

    "Title": "🫥**LONG POST**🫥\n\nHi everyone!\n \nFirst of all, want to give a **big thanks** to everyone in this group, you have all been an immense help in planning my upcoming trip.\n\nI am travelling to Japan in March and I am a lifelong (diagnosed at 9 m.o.) sensitive celiac with really bad reactions to gluten. These reactions have even required hospitalization the last two times I made a mistake (🙃✌️), so I am feeling really anxious regarding this trip, but Japan has been on my bucket list for the longest time.\n\nI have made for myself **a GF map**, **a list of (possibly?) GF products in stores **and **a list of keywords regarding GF diet**. I want to share these with you in hopes it will be of help to someone else in planning their own trip, as I know that so much random information can be really overwhelming. I also apologize for not giving credit to original specific posts, but as I was in the beginning preparing this only for myself and as I have gone through (literally 🥲) hundreds of posts in this group, I really don’t know whose posts I have used to compile this.\n\nThese might be useful especially to **people who are traveling as a part of a group** - my issue is that I am travelling as a part of a travel agency organized group trip and I need to be able to find something (whatever) to eat near me at times when we have free time or breaks for food, so it was really important for me to prepare myself in a way that I do not need to search a lot for the nearest place where I can get something to eat. With that in mind, I have prepared the following:\n\n**1. GF MAP**\n\nI’ve created a GF map showing GF offer in restaurants, bakeries, confectioneries and similar in **Tokyo**, **Kyoto**, **Osaka**, **Hiroshima**, **Nara**, **Nagano** and **Matsumoto**. I have also included some specific stores (like those offering organic produce) and stores that are not as widespread as 7/11, Lawson and Family Mart (as, of course, there is no sense in pinning all of those 😁).\n\nThe way I have compiled the map is that I was searching through this group and the Find me GF app/website for recommendations, and then checking out menus on the official websites of those restaurants, bakeries, etc. I have included only those that specifically mention on their websites keywords like **gluten**, **gluten free **and **celiac disease**.\n\nEach city is marked with its color-specific pins. For each location, I have listed a couple of dishes they offer, just so that I have some general sense of what their offer is. At the end of each description is a code – **N/D (not GF dedicated)** or **D (GF dedicated)**. I have additionally highlighted GF-dedicated objects with **black pins**. I have tried to list all locations alphabetically for each city – there might be some errors, as I was mostly trying not to change the names as they show on Google Maps.\n\n**You can access the map via the following link: https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1QuiUYYbNtotsmNcrjRdXIZ4icOqsmjg&usp=sharing**\n\n❗️DISCLAIMERS❗️\n\n- Although I previously said that I have only included locations that mention gluten, gluten free and celiac disease on their websites, there are a couple of exceptions - such as chain restaurants that have previously been rated safe by members of this group (Coco Ichiban and its allergen free curry, for example).\n\n- In some cases, I was not able to find official menus – when they are not posted on the official website or when there is no official website. In these cases, I would look at the latest version of the menu posted on Google reviews or I would look at menus posted on Find me GF. With that in mind – please use the dishes listed only as **general guidelines** and look for a complete menu/the most updated version of the menu available.\n\n- For the majority of locations, **I haven’t listed cross-contamination information**. There are a couple of exceptions where I added a special note (*) – in these cases, there were either many positive or negative reviews regarding cross-contamination.\n\n- As I am not really a fan of sushi, I haven’t really mentioned sushi places, sorry. 😅\n\n**2) LIST OF (POSSIBLY?) GF PRODUCE IN STORES**\n\nI have gone through hundreds of posts in which people have posted products they have found in **konbinis**, **supermarkets **or **specialized stores**. I have screenshotted those products, put them in a single document and organized them according to the store they were bought at. At the end of the document, there is a large category ‘Unspecified store’ – that is for the products for which the post owner has not listed the store or where I simply missed that info.\n\nI wanted to have this list just to have **SOME starting point **when looking for GF products.\n\n**You can access this list both in Word (in case you want to additionally edit it yourself) and PDF (in case you just want to save it to your phone) via the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zWMGlxQj1xJLk_9fDhsXkKcaamKMmmOL?usp=sharing **\n\n❗️DISCLAIMERS❗️\n\nBIG BIG disclaimer – **a LOT of these might not actually be GF** for several reasons:\n\n1. A lot of people have different levels of tolerance to gluten.\n\n2. A lot of people have different opinions on eating mizuame, unidentified starch, unidentified yeast, etc.\n\n3. A lot of products listed are from several-years-old posts, there is a large chance that the ingredient list has changed.\n\n**PLEASE CHECK EACH PRODUCT FOR YOURSELF BEFORE YOU BUY IT – make sure it is GF, and specifically, that it is GF in a sense that is acceptable for your own experience with celiac disease.**\n\n**3) LIST OF KEYWORDS**\n\nI have compiled a list of **keywords related to the GF diet **just to have a **visual reminder** when checking any suspicious ingredients on a label, or in case a restaurant employee asks for **additional clarification** on my restaurant allergy card.\n\nI have marked ingredients that are explicitly harmful to a person with celiac disease with **red and ‘X’**. The exemption is oats, which are, of course, individual to every person with celiac disease, but as I avoid oats myself, I have marked them with an ‘X’.\n\nI have marked ingredients that are questionable with **yellow and a ‘?’**. These are the ingredients that can be acceptable to celiacs, depending on **what are they derived from** (i.e., mizuame from barley is bad, mizuame from corn is good).\n\n**You can access this list both in Word (in case you want to additionally edit it yourself) and PDF (in case you just want to save it to your phone) via the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mt3H6RuukCGmfV18ROi4K6JRNvUv9HfR?usp=sharing**\n\n❗️DISCLAIMERS❗️\n\nI do not speak Japanese, so these are my best guesses based on a Google search of translations and pronunciations.\n\nI am aware that this may seem like ‘too much’ but I am fully determined not to end up in a hospital in Japan. 🫠🤞\n\nSorry for the long post and I hope these will be helpful to at least one of you out there! 😊\n\nP.S. I also have some questions if you can help me:\n\n1. I have bought my allergy card from Legal Nomads, and I’ve noticed that it does not, for example, mention mizuame. That seems like something I would also like to check when wanting to try some dish that has a sweet element to it, but I am afraid of overwhelming the staff with the allergy card and my additional monologue.\n\nMy question is - how do you usually approach staff without overwhelming them with information and what are some things that you ALWAYS highlight when trying to explain GF and contamination?\n\n2. Which apps for food delivery have you used in Japan?\n\nThanks everyone!\n\n#gfmap #restaurants #bakeries #stores #supermarkets #konbini #list #Tokyo #Osaka #Kyoto #Hiroshima #Nagano #Nara #Mastumoto",

I am Coeliac  so I try my best but I also have moments of letting my guard down and then I know it. But def found some gems! Here’s my experience. \n\nOnigiri (or as we call Sushi Triangles) - salted salmon best snack around- grab from convenience stores and supermarkets.  \nMiso paste- check ingredients you can get GF ones without barley \n\nShibuya\nGonpachi - Great with GF I had the Yakitori with salt and the GF version of the Prawn Tempura bowl. Even came with a GF miso and staff helpful. It’s loud but a great atmosphere, you can book private rooms here also. \nFood show - I love Japanese food halls!! I found you can buy yakitori cooked with salt, and a range of salads and sushi gluten free\n\nHakuba\nHakuba Pizza and some of the other pizza restaurants do GF and home deliver. \nUnjuane (Happo One)- amazing burgers, they will do lettuce versions of burger, I had the beef and the staff were helpful with GF\nCalico (Ecoland) - Will do lettuce version of their burger.\nCampfire Sushi (Ecoland) - these guys have an English menu that is really helpful, I was not able to determine if the sushi rice was safe but i took the risk and ordered the salmon and tuna nigiri, I was ok. Took my own soy. They also do an amazing sashimi bowl that comes with warm rice on the side - prob safer option if worried about sushi rice. \nBase of Tsugaike (next to the foot Onsen) There is a yakitori stand they will cook you chicken yakitori with salt. The other side of foot Onsen is a place that does a vegan and gf curry. \n\nHaneda Airport: Terminal 3 under Villa Fontaine Grand Hotel there are a stack of restaurants, this is what I found. \nHot Pot - I didn’t eat at hot pot but had a great chat with a very helpful restauranteur we worked out I could have the kelp broth but no dipping sauces - so take your own soy or dipping sauce\nSushi restauant- They have a menu with allergens the cooked miso cod was GF\nIndian -The Indian curries are GF (I spoke with the chef) we had butter chicken and chicken tikka was delicious\n\n#hakuba #HanedaAirport #shibuya #tsugaike #calico #gonpachi #foodshow",

    "Title": "Just back from a week in Furano with a coeliac 16yo. We took a half suitcase of gf noodles and microwave meals, plus Carman's bars for snacks on the slopes. This stash proved invaluable as the on-slope dining options were difficult for our coeliac because:\n* The restaurants (next to the Furano Ropeway and the Kitanomine gondola) were fairly busy from about 11.30am-1.30pm. There were few other -- perhaps no other -- dining options on the slopes due to a recent fire in the mountain-top restaurant. \n* Self-ordering, so limited customer-facing staff to discuss gf options.\n* However, steamed rice was available and consumed without a problem.\n\nSome ski and gf tips following our experience:\n* We stayed at the Prince Hotel on the Furano side of the resort. It was ski-in, ski-out, which meant we could come back to the hotel room for lunch -- a big plus. However, dining in the hotel was very expensive, which ruled it out for us as a regular option. The least expensive dinner was the buffet at 6500 yen per person. Three of us were eating for that sum in town. The other restaurants were 8000 yen to 12000 yen pp for dinner. Our room did not have a microwave and the only common microwave was in the hotel souvenir/convenience store. We took a small electric rice cooker we bought from K-Mart and it did the job on the microwave meals (although over 30 mins v 3 mins).\n* Salmon flake onigari from the Lawson and 7-11 convenience stores is good trustworthy snack. Others in this group have mentioned the spicy pollack roe onigari as safe but we avoided due to wheat being mentioned in ingredients when we translated using Google lens.\n* Google lens is very handy for translating ingredients in convenience stores on the fly.\n* A gf card in Japanese helped. Japanese staff happy to read -- and understood the content. We bought ours here and it worked (you also get an English translation): https://www.legalnomads.com/gluten-free/japan/\n* Travel with gf soy or terriyaki sauce\n* We were fairly conservative. When in doubt, we left out. \n* A skiing tip: if you want group ski lessons in English, book a long way out. I would suggest perhaps four weeks in advance ... but I don't know for sure as we missed out (was seeking group lessons for 14yo and 16yo intermediate skiers). There was not an abundance of English-language ski instructors. \n\nAll-in-all a great week of snow and skiing without a glutening. Can recommend the following restaurants in Furano for coeliacs (the first is a new one I hadn't read about in this group before): \n* Ezo Dining: https://www.instagram.com/koko_ezo_dining_?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D Book them by messaging Instagram link above. They are a very welcoming shabu-shabu (Japanese hot pot) restaurant which, once we explained we had a gf diner, prepared a coeliac-safe seaweed broth for cooking. We brought our own gf sauce. 8000 yen for three.\n* Masaya: http://furanomasaya.com Famous teppan restaurant whose owner-chef is well-versed in gf for coeliacs, points out gf dishes and cooks them separately to avoid contamination; also provides gf soy sauce. The food is sensational. 6500 yen for three.\n* Bistro Le Chemin: https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Restaurant_Review-g674811-d4555582-Reviews-Bistro_Le_Chemin-Furano_Hokkaido.html High-quality and more expensive French bistro. I had read here that some coeliacs had visited in the past and had communicated directly with an Aussie chef. This year, it was a Japanese chef and maitre'd. The maitre'd read our gf card carefully and chatted with the chef and me to make some great recommendations. When our taxi was taking too long, he drove us back in his car to the hotel! The deserts were superb, including creme brûlée accompanied by black tea ice-cream. 15,000 yen for three.\n\n       [#gotos](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/gotos?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZXo7IIzIXpwXLyVFeiVd2S4b9t0wrVJD52wvCv0qFFGuchNXBNgxiHqCExea-XXE71grQeK4ztiJlTnZ2fH1MOsEBhcK8FF7rwSOSld5YgQNAa-cWbHgef0SwHK2sQv475Hl2xSajiDjOhNzzYDiYhG&__tn__=R]-R) [#furano](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/furano?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZXo7IIzIXpwXLyVFeiVd2S4b9t0wrVJD52wvCv0qFFGuchNXBNgxiHqCExea-XXE71grQeK4ztiJlTnZ2fH1MOsEBhcK8FF7rwSOSld5YgQNAa-cWbHgef0SwHK2sQv475Hl2xSajiDjOhNzzYDiYhG&__tn__=R]-R) [#masaya](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/masaya?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZXo7IIzIXpwXLyVFeiVd2S4b9t0wrVJD52wvCv0qFFGuchNXBNgxiHqCExea-XXE71grQeK4ztiJlTnZ2fH1MOsEBhcK8FF7rwSOSld5YgQNAa-cWbHgef0SwHK2sQv475Hl2xSajiDjOhNzzYDiYhG&__tn__=R]-R) [#skiing](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/skiing?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZXo7IIzIXpwXLyVFeiVd2S4b9t0wrVJD52wvCv0qFFGuchNXBNgxiHqCExea-XXE71grQeK4ztiJlTnZ2fH1MOsEBhcK8FF7rwSOSld5YgQNAa-cWbHgef0SwHK2sQv475Hl2xSajiDjOhNzzYDiYhG&__tn__=R]-R) [#lawson](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/lawson?__eep__=6&__cft__[0]=AZXo7IIzIXpwXLyVFeiVd2S4b9t0wrVJD52wvCv0qFFGuchNXBNgxiHqCExea-XXE71grQeK4ztiJlTnZ2fH1MOsEBhcK8FF7rwSOSld5YgQNAa-cWbHgef0SwHK2sQv475Hl2xSajiDjOhNzzYDiYhG&__tn__=R]-R)",

I have a question regarding what is allowed to bring into the country. \n\nI am going for a worktrip to Japan and I know it will be very busy, which means I may not have enough time to search for gf options once I’m in the country. Are you allowed to bring these dehydrated ”camping trip” meals into Japan (easy to make it the hotelroom😅)?\nUsually they are made with some type of rice and I read on some pages that it may not be allowed to bring rice into the country, nor meat. \n\nAny suggestions? 😮‍💨",

Huge thanks to this group, we ate well at many of the recommended places in Osaka (Genji Soba), Kyoto (Engine Ramen so good we ate it twice), and Tokyo. It was a little more difficult up in Hokkaido so I thought I'd add the following:\n#Otaru\nWe stayed at the Grand Park Otaru which is in the same building as a nice Eon supermarket and close to a 7-11. The brunch buffet had allergen labels on each dish, not many options for the price but that's Otaru. As with all buffets, there is a risk of cc but the kitchen looked tidy.\nOn an old rec from this group we went to まるいち後藤商店 for dinner. I showed the staff my gf card and the chef came out to point out which items were safe. Their ramen is 100% buckwheat noodles but the broth is no longer gf as they use soy sauce in it. I went with a great plate of tempura veggies and their Otaru chicken which was very good.\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/nbmrkMY6xvz4LXpb7\n#Kiroro\nWe snowboarded two days at Kiroro. I brought lots of safe snacks but noticed that the cafe on the first floor had not only good coffee but also a German-style sausage as well as a potato dish that looked safe but I did not investigate.\n#Yoichi\nWe went for the Nikka distillery tour during a massive snowstorm, when we got off the train we gambled and walked about 15 minutes to Unino Yoichiya for a bowl of sea urchin and rice. I showed my gf card to the staff who told me that the rice + urchin and tuna was safe but the miso soup was not. It was really good and very fresh. My non-gf partner loved the half-crab in miso.",

    "Title": "#niseko\nJust back from a week in Niseko and happy to share our experiences.\nFor breakfasts we took our own gf cereals with us and bought eggs, bacon & baked beans as well at the pharmacy in Hirafu188.\nLunches were hard on the mountain. She had snacks from home in her pockets and we took mostly gf 2 min noodles and asked for hot water. The place at the base of Hanazono happily filled these for ¥200, the restaurant at the Hirafu Gondola fussed as not allowed to bring in own food but I showed them our GF card and then they agreed to (plus we were a group of 11 and the other 10 were ordering from the menu). Boyo mountain hut at Hirafu happily filled it but the water was luke warm and the noodles remained raw so she ended up with a bowl of their rice and we had taken our own gf soy sauce which came in handy plus a sprinkling of noodle flavouring. We also took a thermos and prepared gf Mac & cheese (from home) in our apartment before heading out a couple of days.\nDinners - we tried to make our own one night but honestly it was so hard to find ingredients and took so long using translator app that I actually think eating out was easier.\nThe Vale - could do a gf burger, no chips/wedges were safe but the burger was fine. We ended up going here twice.\nWild Bills were easily able to accommodate (tex mex)\nR Niseko pizza we were told did gf pasta - which they did but it took an extra 20 mins for them to prepare (🤷🏼‍♀️) . The pasta looked and tasted suspiciously like regular pasta but she had no reaction so maybe it was just very good gf pasta?? She said it was delicious but the long wait had her almost in tears from hunger as we were only able to get an 8.30pm booking\nKumo Restaurant at Skye Niseko was amazing and a favourite. She was able to eat the rice, the skewers without the glaze, a cold tofu dish and salmon hand roll. All very good. They couldn’t guarantes the miso ”may contain” but she risked it and was fine.\nThe Alpinist she was able to eat the raclette and also the fondue (minus the bread). Delicious.\nHope this helps!",

It will be served without you requesting it and you will be charged for it even if you don’t eat it. It’s customary in places like bars and Izakayas. It can be confusing when food turns up that you didn’t order and you might  expect not to pay for it that it might be complimentary. In some cases you may be able to request before you sit down not to be served it but given this contributes to the financial operations of a business it’s best just to accept it graciously. Unfortunately it’s very rare that it would be gluten free. Edamame can be an Otoshi dish which is gluten free but you need to check the water used for boiling them was not contaminated by boiling wheat noodles.",

I’m using the NIMA sensor as just another tool in my arsenal to keep myself safe from sickness and harm. I’m well aware of its limitations with detecting gluten in fermented foods such as soy sauce. But since it is expensive BUT could be helpful to others, I’m sharing results here so that other people can have access to the information. You don’t have to trust the results I post. What food one chooses to eat, what risks to take, are deeply personal decisions. Always do what’s best for you. \n\nNIMA Sensors can only test a pea-sized portion of food, not an entire dish, so cross contamination is still possible. Use of a NIMA Sensor is not a replacement for reading food labels, asking questions, or being cautious and diligent. \n\nWith all that said, please understand that because I’m very sensitive to gluten, I research every single thing that I eat. I only post ✨safe✨test results on foods that I have consumed myself with zero reaction. Thank you for your time and have a great day!)🚨",

    "Title": "Hi All,\nI went to Japan in November 2023 and posted my review of places shortly after. But I’ve finally updated our plan, which I thought I would share here should it help anyone.\nI can’t stress the importance of planning. Basically I worked out places to visit and then found food options near by. I booked as many places as possible. Booking places meant i could confirm gluten free options. The majority of places I booked I found from this group. I showed my translation card to a few places but all said no. \nWe visited a friend who lives in Tokyo so he also helped me. Having the plan made the situation so much easier. Yes sometimes things didn’t work out and I had a seven eleven lunch but this only happened once. Yes I was a little sad that I couldn’t just wing it but Atleast this way I knew I would be getting safe food.\nHappy to answer any questions.\nJust can’t stress how important it is to plan your Japan trip.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/glutenfreeexpatsjapan/permalink/2529132273963982/?mibextid=W9rl1R",

I’m not a hugely reactive coeliac and so am just rolling with cross contamination and the occasional thing with a little bit of soy sauce in it for 3.5 weeks to help retain a dash of sanity!\n\nThe hubby wanted me to add in how fabulous the service was - it really was, they went above and beyond to figure out what I could and couldn’t eat and were honestly really great! Could not fault the service. \n\nEspecially after lunch when we went to a different place that had no gluten free mains.

    "Title": "Our 3-week trip has been absolutely incredible! 🇯🇵 Feeling grateful for this group and keen to pay it forward for future travellers.\n\nSo not only am I gluten free, I am also dairy free, red meat free (only occasions), steer clear from sugar, processed foods and having oil-heavy meals. I have a few gut issues and work really hard to avoid putting junk into my body. And to top it off, my partner is vegan too. It’s safe to say that food was certainly an obstacle for us, however we managed to stay well fed. Here are my tips!\n\n**Tokyo**\n\n🍴Gluten free Ts  \nThey need no intro to this group. I ordered the chicken noodle dish twice in a row. Available on Uber eats.\n\n🍴 Crisp salad works shibuya square - \nCustom made salad bowls! You have complete control over everything they put in it. Available on Uber eats too. \n\n**Fujikawaguchiko**\n\nThis place was a highlight in terms of sightseeing and the sheer beauty of the lake/mt Fuji. HIGHLY recommend. However, many of the Japanese here don’t even know what gluten free or vegan is. We luckily had our own kitchen and cooked every dinner (it did take a good 1.5 hours in the supermarket using google translate). We did find one lunch spot that we loved:\n\n🍴 Shaw’s \n\nAbsolutely delicious! We had lunch here twice in a row. They have a gluten free, vegan menu and all they are receptive to making things gluten free to suit. The hostess speaks excellent English and is extremely helpful. \n\n**Kyoto**\n\nWe lucked out a little here as we arrived on the 2nd of jan which is a string of public holidays. This meant most places were closed. We relied on Uber eats for the first few days as we biked around the city for hours trying to find open restaurants when we first arrived. Here were the food highlights:\n\n🍴 Waco crepes\n\nThey were actually closed when we arrived and re-opened just for us! The lovely lady there wrote out a whole list of vegan restaurants for my partner too. Lovely people and delicious filing crepes that didn’t make me feel awful after eating.\n\n🍴 Zero waste\n\nI’m not kidding when I say we came here for lunch and snacks on four occasions. Mutsumi was so accomodating and takes pride in every meal. They offer gluten free cupcakes (try the matcha muffin you won’t regret it!), chicken salad, pork pate (I didn’t try but looked good) and other meals. Great for vegans too. I got the chicken salad every time because the vegetables and condiments changed daily. They also serve vegan curry, quiche and cheese cake.\n\n🍴玄 gen\n\nThis is a hole-in-the-wall take away only vegan and gluten free restaurant. Lots of curry’s and vegetable style dishes and tofu. Also lots of sweets. He doesn’t use heavy oils or refined sugar. I had the chai scone - which was good however if you don’t like the taste of sweets without sugar it’s probably not for you.\n\n🍴 Root2lab (Uber eats)\n\nThis place was my jam. Make-your-own salad bowls. The only kicker is you’ll need to use google translate while using the Uber eats app. I put in the instructions ‘GLUTEN FREE - WHEAT ALLERGY’ and felt perfect after the two times I ordered from them. I recommend writing ‘more toppings then lettuce please’\n\n🍴 Sugarhill\n\nLovely hosts, good English, great understanding of food allergies. The first thing they ask is what food allergies you have. My partner got the vegan pasta and I got the terriyuki salmon. Delicious! Make a booking. \n \n**Nara**\n\nWe stayed in Nara for one night and I HIGHLY recommend doing so. We spent the first day riding around Nara and exploring. The next day got up at 6am which meant zero tourists. You can literally walk around the park surrounded by deer - it’s magical. The forest is underrated and worth checking out too. \n\n🍴 We stayed at a Ryoken called Tabist which includes half board (breakfast and dinner)\n\nWhilst the staff don’t speak fluent English, they understand food allergies. We were served what I would say was my favourite meal in Japan! Gluten free for me, vegan for partner. We were so so full afterwards. Amazing value for this stay. \n\n🍴 Total Therapy cafe salon school studio KURURU\n\nThis organic cafe is a hidden gem - they believe food is medicine. Most of their dishes are gluten free - you actually get to pick which rice noodle flavour you want (tomato, kelp, brown rice etc). My partner got the curry and said it was his fave dish of the trip.  Their English isn’t great however the menu is extremely informative and they understand dietary requirements.\n\n🍴 Big Mountain Cafe＆Farm\n\nWow, where do I start with this place? Incredible food, hosts and atmosphere. They have a chicken dish with rice, salad and condiments. I asked if they could make the chicken grilled instead of fried and do extra salad instead of chips which they were happy to do. They have a full gluten free menu which is easy to navigate. I recently quit coffee and have been drinking cacao - it was so good to see it on their menu… and it was the best cacao I’ve had in my life!! Unfortunately she doesn’t sell it otherwise I would have bought 10 packs to take back to Australia. Do not miss this place!\n\n**Takayama**\n\n🍴 Sushi dining nob\n\nHuge list of western style sushi. If you’re looking for basic no surprise lunch, perfect spot. \n\n🍴 Heianruku\n\nThis was an absolute highlight in terms of restaurant experience!! We were lucky to be the only ones in the restaurant. The couple who run the restaurant are engaging, friendly and go the extra mile. We had a chat to them throughout our whole dining experience, showing them photos from Australia which they were so grateful for. They have an allergy sheet they provide so that you can point to everything you can’t eat. The chef made me a personalised meal with less oil (chicken rice and veggies) and my partner had a vegan gluten free ramen. We both got gluten free dumplings which were the best we have ever had! They give you a cute little starter dish and a snack at the end. I also couldn’t believe how much the whole experience cost us! $5300yen for two meals, dessert and a small bottle of sake (plus the complimentary starters) Extremely grateful for the experience. They are also very responsive over email (they changed our reservation from dinner to lunch within a hours notice). \n\n**Hakuba**\n\n🍴 Penke Bar\n\nWestern style menu. Staff mostly Aussie. Dietary requirements clearly marked on menu. I had the pork cutlet with cabbage and chips which was good (not something I’d usually order). \n\n🍴 Hybrid￼\n\nIf you’re feeling fancy, this place is for you. Everything on the menu other than 2 dishes are gluten free. The owner Leo is extremely friendly, speaks excellent English (From canada) and has a great understanding of dietary restrictions. They made a custom vegan dish for my partner and I had the pickles, hybrid salad and roast chicken. Best chicken I’ve ever had! Excellent service. They do walk-ins however I’d book as I saw a few people get turned away. Really nice wine too if you enjoy a glass. \n\n🍴 Gravityworx \n\nItalian restaurant serving pasta and pizza. Quirky place with an eccentric owner who loves a chat. GF rice penne. I got the tuna, tomato and mushroom pasta and it was honestly the best pasta I’ve had In a long time…. Basic but done right. They also ferment and farm most of their ingredients which is cool! \n\n🍴 Mr Myagi \n\nJapanese (western vibe) casual dining part of a hotel. Very basic   - lots of gluten free options (and they can do a few of the dishes vegan). I got teriyaki chicken and a side salad. Chicken was good. Side salad was literally two pieces of lettuce thrown together with no dressing… not a lot of veggies with the chicken dish too. Was still OK. Nice friendly staff.\n\n🍴 Sol organics (at the base of the Goryu ski resort)\n\nThey have gluten free and vegan snacks - we literally got their snacks every 3rd day. Matcha cakes, cookies, brownies, scones…. GF/DF heaven. Was nice to know we were eating organic produce too. I got the hot ginger drink which was delicious. \n\n🍴 Roots Cafe\n\nVegetarian place with lots of GF options - gyozas, falafels etc. my partner got the falafel curry and said it was pretty good. I tried the gyozas which were delicious. \n\n🍴 A-coop supermarket\n\nHas a GF section with pancake mixes, muffin mixes, curry’s etc. would need a kitchen to utilise this section. \n\n🍴 Hakuba pizza\n\nGood selection, they do gluten free, vegan cheese. We got delivery - took 30 mins. Pizza itself was a little soggy but still really yum. Good comfort food. \n\n🍴 Lion cafe\n\nLots of gluten free snacks/muffins/treats - all clearly marked. I had the rice chicken bowl. Very light lunch. Healthy and fresh.\n\nRandom other tips - \n💡 When in doubt, 7/11 three items. Grilled chicken, rice and a packet of salad. I always had apple cider vinegar with me as a go-to dressing. Don’t make the mistake of accidentally buying chicken giblets 🤢 \n💡 7/11 plum sushi is gluten free and vegan\n💡 Allergy cards work so well. Sometimes we would try to explain what our dietary requirements were and only when we pulled out the allergy cards did it click. \n💡 If you are doing a longer trip like us - we did 3 weeks - book places with kitchens where you can. You will be forever grateful you did that once you realise how tricky navigating GF is.\n💡 A lot of the rice cakes are gluten free in the supermarkets and there is literally an entire isle of them. If you have the time, get your google translate app and start scanning. It’s worth it because they are all delicious!\n\nHopefully this helps with your planning 🇯🇵✨",

Thank you to this wonderful group for making it much more stress free than I was anticipating for our 15 year old coeliac. \n\nStayed at ヒルトン東京　Hilton Tokyo \nWe booked club floor rooms so we had access to the lounge. Everything is clearly labelled with allergens & the staff can provide gf bread. The lounge is definitely worth it for the ease of breakfast & evening canapes that became dinner on our last night. \nWe had dinner on our first night at the grill. It was quite expensive but very convenient to stay in the hotel after an overnight flight the night before.

It was the best night. We sat at the tappanyaki grill & watched the action. All the staff communicated well & our girl was well looked after. \n\nOn day 2 we hit a hurdle. I had been planning our day around lunch at Shimbu Sakiya Ramen in Shibuya however when we got there, they claimed they did not have room for 5 of us & that was the end of the discussion. The lady closed the door in our face. We could see that they had room for at least our coeliac however we had no choice but to accept & move on. The 4 non gluten free ate elsewhere , then I googled, used the Find Me Gluten Free app & this page. We jumped on a train & made our way to Harajuku. Thankfully My Bahn Mi by Gluten Free saved the day. They fed the hungry teenager & all was well. \n\nOverall, it was great trip, made better by this page.",

If you can reserve in advance or show up early (before 6pm) so you’re not disappointed.\n\n#Mr Miyagis - Run by an Aussie. They seemed to know about gluten free but as someone else mentioned I would be careful about cross contamination. Had #Okonomiyaki, it was delicious! \n\n#Japanese Dining Kyoto - had the wagyu #Shabu shabu. The stock was only water, so had to add a bit of salt for taste. They had gluten free soy sauce out the back. A few other item on the menu were obviously GF like grilled prawns. \n\n#uncle stevens great #Tex Mex. The kitchen serves food fast, so could be some CC. Had beef tacos and Nachos. \n\n#Taco Taco - loved this place. Gf fajitas were tasty and filling when asked for more corn fajitas. The #margaritas were dangerous. \n\n#Bears cafe - understood about coeliac, said they couldn’t guarantee no CC. Dish was delicious, just a bit on the small side.\n\n#The campfire sushi and cafe - sushi rice had soy sauce in it so opted for tuna rice bowl and edamame. Fish was really fresh but on the smaller side if you’re a big eater.\n\n#Hakuba kebab - Had beef with rice. Definitely the most affordable dish I had in #Hakuba. I didn’t get any CC but they don’t change the gloves after handling the flour kebabs. \n\nOn the hills -\n Every place had at least a rice bowl with some veggies when asked.\n\n#Happo1 couldn’t find much on the hill, but #uncle Steven’s tex mex is a few minutes from happo gondola base. \n#Goryu - veggie curry with rice.\n#IWATAKE - chicken curry with rice",

    "Title": "Thank you for the incredible recommendations in this group.  Just back from a three week holiday.  Family of 5 travelling with 2 Coeliac teenagers. \n\nA couple of tips and recommendations. \n\nHakuba\nHakuba Pizza - excellent - they also deliver.  Can take a while to deliver, order early and very worth the wait.  They can run out of gluten free bases though. \n\nMr Miyagi - so good, so accommodating. Great good, great atmosphere, great owner, book ahead. \n\nTokyo\nToranomon Hills Station - T Market\nLa Boucherie - great meat and other gluten free sides and very obliging and helpful with gluten free \n\nT’s Kitchen very good as mentioned. Very small and best to book. \n\nKyoto \nNohga Hotel - Cicon restaurant.  Good dinner options. Helpful staff. \n\nBreakfast is good here too, upon request they can arrange great gluten free bread\n\nWe found Kyoto the hardest part to find places to eat. \n\nOsaka\nTaqueria La Fonda\nAs mentioned it was excellent! Must book, we went three times and everyone loved it. Very small but great fun and great food. \n\nKobebeef Teppanyaki RIO Osaka\nLocated in the ground level of The Royal Park Hotel Iconic. \nThey said they couldn’t do gluten free, but with some careful google translating work, we managed it.  We had lunch here twice which ranges from 22 - 28 yen for tepoanyaki beef, salad, cooked veggies and unlimited rice. We omitted the Miso soup for the Coeliacs.  It was excellent.  \n\nAnother thing I did before I left was vacuum sealed small portions of gf cereal for my kids to take down to breakfast each morning in case things got tricky. We also took some on the planes and just ask for some milk in a bowl. \n\nHope this helps, as I was very grateful for all the recommendations I found in here. \nThank you",

    "Title": "## **#Kyushu Region**\n\n***Post 2 of 5***\n\nI started the bulk of my travels in one of the harder areas to find GF food, BUT so beautiful and well worth it despite the more limited options. If I had limited time, I'd definitely suggest either reaching out to https://www.facebook.com/kyushujourneys/ or https://glutenfreetoursjapan.com.au/ to help you, as it just isn't as populated as other areas, and english was also even more limited than in the major places.\n\n**#Takachiho**\n\nFirst up, one of the popular instagram places, Takachiho Gorge 😉 For those who need the alternative milks, #Nobeoka station does have a Starbucks!\n\nWe stayed at Solest Takachiho, a newer property in Takachiho. I couldn’t find any options that catered to GF in town, and so we just went with this. It couldn’t accommodate for dinner, and breakfast was plain rice. Hotel itself was fine.\n\nNagomi\n* This is a butcher shop and restaurant that specializes in Takachiho beef, one of the main areas for wagyu beef. I did show my allergy text to the waiter, but as there was such limited gluten on the menu, I didn't push cross contamination protocol in the kitchen. He indicated I could eat the rice and the beef, and the veggies that came with the beef, and I avoided the sauces and the little dishes that came on the side (the salad, the seaweed salad, miso soup). It was excellent meat.\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/BJj2NV5ry1Yxecn76\nhttps://takachiho.ja-miyazaki.jp/pages/44/\n\nTakachihogamadase Market\n* This is a market that sells products local to the area (both packaged and fresh), right next door to Nagomi. I was able to find a few gluten free products, including these really yummy little cookies made from rice bran.\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/j3qcqZdy2qB4Jxww6\n\nCafé Terrace Tachachihoya -\n* This café has the sweetest owner! She was very responsive on instagram messages and though her café isn't 100% GF, I felt completely safe eating here. I was able to eat the majority of her menu (see image for what is GF) and she also has soy milk for lattes for those with lactose intolerance. Definitely suggest if you're in the area!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/takachihoya/\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/KuJPfr5yVemLqy1k9\n\n**#Beppu, **an onsen town on the coast. I couldn't find any options via google (other than Coco Ichibanya and Kura Sushi) but as we were there for 24 hours, just to see the 7 Hells, I was prepared to just deal. The hotel find was great though, so I got to eat after all. There was one onsen that we did want to try, and the steam cooking seemed like it should be gluten free (just without the sauces they give to add after) but they were closed the days that we were for cleaning. For reference though, this was it: https://www.hyotan-onsen.com/english/\n\nGalleria Midobaru hotel was such a beautiful property AND they were able to accommodate gluten free for both dinner and breakfast AND it was super tasting! The mushrooms and veggies were absolutely delicious, and breakfast was so big that I couldn’t finish half of it! It is pricier though, but it was really nice to have a great meal AND such a nice property.\n* https://beppu-galleria-midobaru.jp/en/\n\nMyoban Yunosato Onsen - this is a little complex with one big souvenir shop and one smaller more boutique one, a little open air museum of sorts to see the huts they use to collect the salt in, and then a very cute open air onsen at the top of the complex with a sweet man who runs it. He serves these onsen water boiled eggs (they do taste like sulphur 😉 ) and down by the bigger souvenir shop they also sell onsen water boiled corn. Both are good snacks, and from everything I googled, gluten free. I didn't ask, and didn't have any side effects.\n* https://maps.app.goo.gl/E5FXg49Jv1Veomuh8\n* http://yuno-hana.jp/\n\n**#Yufuin, or #Yufu, **another onsen town, inland from Beppu, about 1 hour by bus, and another place that had very limited options when I googled, but the description of the Edo style town made me want to stop in for a quick visit. Don't laugh, but we found an Indian here, that was incredible - and wound up eating both dinner and lunch at, as it was so good and gluten safe!\n* Avatar Indian - I asked about the curries and if they were safe, and the waitress quickly assured me they were fine. We had one of the dal's, a veggie curry and the aubergine curry - which was our favourite. Hands down though, some of the best Indian food I've ever had. But note there is a chance of cross contam as it's not 100% GF. \n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/sB322DAHuoYisSDS8\n\nThe other option that came up, was this one, just for reference as there's not a lot around!\n* Café Siesta\nABOUT | cafesiesta\nSiesta Organic Cafe (シエスタオーガニックカフェ) (@siesta_organic) • Instagram photos and videos\n\nThe ryokan that we stayed at couldn't accommodate me for dinner or breakfast - Besso Shiksai http://www.shikisai-hotel.jp/ -  I couldn't find any through googling that would, but I didn't reach out to any to ask any others specifically either, as the majority were already full for the days we needed.\n\n**#Kurokawa Onsen -** an incredibly beautiful onsen town in the mountains, and my favourite place on my whole trip! There are pretty much no options for dining outside your ryokan - let alone gluten free - and this was my only place that I wound up eating my rice crackers and individual peanut butter packets! However, it turns out that my ryokan would have been able to accommodate me, but it was lost in translation before my arrival. They couldn't manage dinner on the short notice, but breakfast was a win - and my first true ryokan breakfast experience!\n\nWafu Ryokan Misato\n* I couldn't find any email for them, and communicated via Booking.com - I would suggest calling and getting the meal sorted in advance, as they are able! At check in - which they do with you in your room, so it's very relaxed - the girl took my questions on gluten very seriously, and took screen shots of my allergy text. She went to speak to the kitchen and then came back, checked my notes again, took another screen shot, went back to the kitchen and then came back and said that breakfast was 100% no issue, and she was very very apologetic and said that dinner would have been possible, but it was too late in the day by then to sort for that day. Very sweet staff, big Japanese style rooms, and a smaller family run ryokan.\n* https://maps.app.goo.gl/qUjDGEpAHsd1rNf29\n* http://www.kurokawa-misato.jp/\n\nGoto Liquor Store\n* I scoured the shelves at this local konbini and there are snack options like chips and fruit - and liquor 😉 No onigiri (none left at that time of night anyways)\n* https://maps.app.goo.gl/bibhUfDASnsZHW5NA\n\nI did find one place by chance, and I highly recommend - particularly as there are not a lot of restaurant options, at any time of the day - outside of your ryokan meals!\n\n黒川温泉 予祝 よしゅく and in english Yosei - Check out their website - it's a very neat concept of connecting earth/ people/ food. I only ate lunch at Yosei, but there is a sister restaurant and a ryokan as well, that would be worth checking out for gluten friendly. At Yosei, they have a small plates menu, with a few options that looked gluten friendly. The Kumamoto beef was possible GF, and it was excellent.\n* https://www.okyakuya.jp/en/\n* https://maps.app.goo.gl/CAWiziuRWwfMBkRh7\n\n**#Ureshino - **a tea town, in Saga, the other side of Kyushu. I stopped here as I wanted to check out the regional tea center - which was manned by these super sweet ladies, and I highly recommend if you're in the area - but was aware that again, there weren't a lot of options that I could find via googling anyways.\n\nUreshino Tea Exchange Museum: Chaoshiru- I did the tea pouring class and the tie dying class, and confirmed that the teas that I was trying were not the barley tea/ mugi cha. None of the sweets they have in the café were possible though - at least not the one's that were there when I was there.\n* https://maps.app.goo.gl/goMsWEtGTLRH7s9r7\n* https://www.city.ureshino.lg.jp/.../ureshi.../_23805.html...\n\nHamilton Hotel - They were not able to accommodate me for dinner, but, breakfast was possible - I have to say that I wasn't 100% positive it was all gluten free, so I just ate the rice, fruit and hard boiled egg as I just couldn't be bothered to triple check! No alternative milks for coffee.\n* https://www.hamilton-ureshino.jp/\n\nIf you do find yourself here, I'd suggest checking out Wataya Besso property - they didn't have space for my dates, but have a few different restaurants, that looked like they'd be open to dealing with dietary restrictions\n* https://wataya.co.jp/\n\nMonte Stella - an Italian restaurant that was able to accommodate me with gluten free and I felt safe eating at. I explained to the hotel staff and they called to check and it was deemed possible. I then showed my allergy text to the service staff at the restaurant, and indicated the items that I had thought would be fine, and they visibly thought for a moment, and then nodded their heads. It was simple food - grilled chicken and vegetable antipasta - but I felt comfortable with it and didn't get sick.\n* https://www.montestella.jp/\n* https://maps.app.goo.gl/fMaYREcD6HBQtfst9",

I ordered pizza and we were still able to eat it at the cafe next door. This time we ordered  Pepperoni and the margarita pizza. Previously I tried the pesto with anchovies but it was a little fishy for me personally. I was able to get their curry bread rolls with the pizza and all three flavors are delicious (pork, plain, and cheesy). They are also great for a shinkansen ride!!!\n\n*The cafe next door is now a beet themed restaurant without gluten free options but if you order a drink (one per guest) they don't mind if you eat the pizza there. They do ask that you return the pizza box to the bakery rather than leaving it for them to dispose of, which makes sense. I ordered coffee and kids had Maccha lattes (they don't have to be gluten free, so I didn't check the gluten free status. The latter can often contain wheat.) They cafe owner and helper were extremely pleasant and made our visit even better. :) \n\nA cute thing happened while we were eating our pizza. A couple had come in to order one of the sets and saw us enjoying their pizza. The man darted out to order one too (miso with white fish) and he and his partner seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. So the pizza is tasty even for non gf people. \n\n#Tokyo #Ricehack #Omotesando",

I went to Kanauta which does use barley in some of their products but the guy can tell you exactly which ones. I had their chocolate cake. For a proper meal we went to steakland for a lunch set menu. We got the tender steak one and they said they don’t use wheat, mostly is was simple fresh ingredients so I felt safe but there was some sauce on the side I decided to pass on, but my husband didn’t use that either since the steak was great by itself. You can make a reservation or show up and wait in line, we went at 10am and got first place which meant we came back just before 11 and went straight in. I also spent a proportionately ridiculous amount on those candied apples cut up and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar which I have no idea if it was safe or not but I figured hopefully it’s just sugar and water with some food colouring. Either way it was divine and I didn’t feel sick afterwards soooo 🤞🏻 I’d do it again. We tried to make a booking for Hanasato but they didn’t reply to our message I think as they were just opening back up after the holiday period. At Nishimura coffee and I managed to order the gratin without toast which hopefully works well - update: I felt a little off afterwards but I’m also lactose intolerant which I did take my pills for. I wouldn’t do it again as I’m not fully convinced but that could be my error in not taking enough lactaid. The ice creams look ridiculously good though 😂 \n\nSide notes of things I’ve learned - the sweet potatoes at 7/11, kombini’s, roadside places are amazing. I’ve eaten soo much rice - those are an incredible alternative and so easy to miss. \nI have been struggling with proteins - mostly eating eggs and the salmon in an onigiri or sashimi/sushimi.\nI have no idea why but I’m struggling to find mochi without wheat. It seems like everyone I come across has wheat in it! I’ve had one since I’ve arrived and I love them so it’s driving me insane a little! Rant over! \nAny suggestions welcome!",

(otsuna-sushi.com)\n* Kushiage      Su - [https://www.tablecheck.com/shops/glutenfree-kushiage-su/reserve](https://www.tablecheck.com/shops/glutenfree-kushiage-su/reserve)\n\nFor the rest, in Tokyo is where I ate the most at places that weren't 100% dedicated GF - and I definitely cannot vouch that they were all great with cross contamination. That is definitely partially down to me. I was with friends for the most part while eating out in Tokyo and I found it tough to do more than ask for things to be without sauce, not wanting to make a bigger fuss by pushing the service staff on cross contamination in the kitchen. I did \"guide\" our restaurant selections in advance for options that I figured were the safest, searching them in the group and on google to see other people's experiences etc… and then just hoped for the best. Anyways, my comments below, so others can make their own decisions!\n\n**#Ginza and surrounding area**\n\nFANCL Brown Rice meals - this is 100% GF and I tried to walk in on a Sunday and they had no space. They have two seatings, so do make a booking I'd say, to avoid not getting a seat. It's in the basement of the FANCL building, so not obvious from the street.\n* https://maps.app.goo.gl/L31gQkrQDbsXLBQo7\n* [https://fanclbrownricemeals.foodre.jp/](https://fanclbrownricemeals.foodre.jp/)\n\nBill's - I ate at both the Ginza and Odaiba locations, and had the same dish: the buckwheat and quinoa salad. I asked the server, and they brought me a print out with all their dishes and the different allergens. I found what I could have, and then asked her to tell the kitchen I needed it gluten free. I cannot vouch for their cross contamination protocols, but felt fairly comfortable eating here. I wouldn't choose to go on my own, but given the rest of the group wasn't gluten free, I felt comfortable enough.\n* [https://billsjapan.com/en/ginza](https://billsjapan.com/en/ginza)\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/XWTSJ3DzgyWTZiDT7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/XWTSJ3DzgyWTZiDT7)\n\nTsukiji Sushi Say Honten - in the fish market block, this was a great experience. They don’t take reservations, and lines up start 30 min before they open. There are 2 locations it seems; we were at the one closest to the road. We got seats at the bar upstairs, and had our own sushi master that prepared the food for us. I did show him my allergy text for sushi, and he couldn't answer on the vinegar, so we decided together that I would stick to sashimi. It was really yummy sashimi, but the experience was what made it great - the 4 sushi masters behind the bar were super relaxed and joking (in Japanese, so no idea what they said ha ha) and laughing with each other. He was also able to indicate which sake was 100% rice, so all in all, I was able to eat and drink safely, and we all enjoyed our meal immensely.\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/rCAyBb54AgEAbn8r8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rCAyBb54AgEAbn8r8)\n* [http://www.tsukijisushisay.co.jp/store/honten.html](http://www.tsukijisushisay.co.jp/store/honten.html)\n\nSoranoiro Nippon Ramen - I did try this place, and appreciated having a warm meal that I could eat while out for the day. As others have said, the Ramen street is like a hidden row that runs parallel to the main row - it took us a while to find it! You have to like go around a corner to get to that row. At the shop, you order on the machine outside the shop, and there is a gluten free button you choose first. I asked for help, just as a double check that she was flagging it as gluten free. I also asked if it was in different boiling water, and she said yes. The gyozas were also gluten free it seems. It was warm and filling, and gluten free, but other than that, I wouldn't go back. I also didn't feel fabulous after, but again, it's hard to know if this was due to any cross contam.\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/gnaHYWp8aYT48Lqr5](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gnaHYWp8aYT48Lqr5)\n* [https://soranoiro-vege.com/](https://soranoiro-vege.com/)\n\n**#Hiroo area**\n\nLa Jolla - a little Mexican place just past the Starbucks. Generally Mexican is a fairly safe bet for getting a gluten free meal, with limited cross contamination, and again, I was in a mixed group so this was the safest compromise when we were out and about and just needed lunch one day. I asked the owner about gluten, and he pointed out what I could have. I can't vouch for cross contamination in the kitchen, and I'm not sure that I would try this one again.\n\nEat Play Work building - this a neat concept right by the Hiroo metro station, with a few floors of different restaurants that each have a counter area you can sit at, or, you can take your food to sit in one of the common areas. Definitely not all gluten free, but if you're in mixed company, it could be a good location as you can all order what you want.\n* I ate at     Salam, the Middle      Eastern place, and the owner was able to clearly tell me what did/ did not      have gluten, but, cross contamination is definitely an issue here for      those very sensitive (and did bite me in the butt) and she clearly stated      that she's not a gluten free venue. I wouldn't suggest it, if you are at      all sensitive.\n   * 【公式】Salam(サラーム) | EAT PLAY WORKS-THE       RESTAURANT 広尾 (salt-group.jp)\n* Oxomoco is a mexican inspired      venue, and from the menu it looked like it might be easier to make gluten      free and free of cross contam, but I didn’t have a chance to try      unfortunately.\n   * [Official] OXOMOCO | EAT PLAY       WORKS-THE RESTAURANT Hiroo (salt-group.jp)\n\n**#Asakusa Area**\n\nMarugoto **-** 100% gluten free and vegan café on the river. It's small, just a few tables, and quite healthy :-) But, it's filling and safe to eat at, which is a win!\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/ztFCzCsLq2Ayy2QK8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ztFCzCsLq2Ayy2QK8)\n* [https://dining.marugotovegan.com/](https://dining.marugotovegan.com/)\n\nSho Chiku En** -** 100% GF and vegan café, with a sweet story of why they opened. We stopped in for a cake and coffee/ matcha latte. I had the tiramisu and my friend had the Mont Blanc. Match was good, the cakes were also good. I didn't try any of the savoury dishes, but there definitely a handful of uber eats or similar bikers coming in to get orders! It's nice to have a completely safe option if you're around Senso-Ji Temple.\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/mmgaYLYbLeDmbVMo7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mmgaYLYbLeDmbVMo7)\n* [https://sho-chiku-en.com/](https://sho-chiku-en.com/)\n\n**#Shinjuku area**\n\nMarbre Café** -** this is a vegan cake and coffee shop right by Shinjuku Gyoen Park, and the Shinjuku entrance. The staff was very sweet with explaining what options were GF (not all are) and I thoroughly enjoyed the caramel dessert I chose for takeaway, on the grass in the park next door. I didn’t ask about their cross contamination protocols in the kitchen, but based on previous comments, I was comfortable eating the dessert and didn’t get sick!\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/MuAVtRSQo3G9JQmV6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MuAVtRSQo3G9JQmV6)\n* [https://www.facebook.com/marbrevegn/](https://www.facebook.com/marbrevegn/)\n\n**#Roppongi area**\n\nGluten Free T’s Kitchen** - **I went a few different times, and only once had to wait a few minutes, but it's quite small inside, that I can see it's better to make a reservation if you really want to eat here. It's great that it's 100% GF so just no worries at all on cross contamination, and I definitely appreciated being able to pop in for lunch, but I found the food *just ok* personally. Gyoza's were good, and the cajun fried chicken (though it's a HUGE portion of ONLY the chicken) but I didn't love the miso corn ramen, the tempura, nor the takoyaki balls.\n* [https://glutenfree.co.jp/](https://glutenfree.co.jp/)\n\nGonpachi**- **I ate at the Nishi-Azabu location, and as some others have mentioned, there isn't a specific gluten free menu here. Our waitress didn't understand what I was asking, her colleague did, and then rattled off a list of the items I could have to her in Japanese. The waitress then turned around and pointed them out to me on the menu, but there was a lot of uncertainty from her if she had remembered it all. She did confirm the tempura would be made in a separate fryer, and that it would take longer, and it did come out later than the rest of the table's dishes. I was not overly confident with both her recollection of what I could/ couldn't have, and, what was happening in the kitchen, so I just stuck to chicken skewers with salt and the tempura. I didn't feel the best after, but I can't say if this was due to cross contam, or just something else.\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/UxnFumtuhw4XUerbA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UxnFumtuhw4XUerbA)\n* [https://gonpachi.jp/nishi-azabu/](https://gonpachi.jp/nishi-azabu/)\n\nMeatman - again, not a dedicated GF restaurant, and it's at your own risk for cross contamination. I didn't even bother telling them I had a gluten allergy here - it was so busy and pretty much 100% Japanese - so I just picked the skewers that were salt only, checked with the waitress that they had no sauce, and hoped for the best. This was also based on what I had read that generally in izakaya's they don’t use the same part of the grill for salt only and with sauce skewers as it affects the taste. All in all, it went well, and I didn't feel ill. It's an interesting concept - they are known for wrapping their skewers in bacon - and I wound up having a variety of vegetables with salt only (some wrapped in bacon, some plain), and a chicken wrapped in bacon.\n\n**#Harajuku area**\n\nLas Dos** **Caras **- **I wound up eating here three times just due to ease/ me being able to eat here! Again, Mexican is often a safer bet, and I didn't feel ill any of the times I ate here. However, I didn't check cross contamination protocols in the kitchen. I checked which of the dishes were with corn tortillas (the majority are) and know they are usually heated up differently than flour tortillas, so figured the level of cross contamination was low. The guacamole is made at your table, and delicious, as are the margaritas.\n* [https://www.huge.co.jp/restaurant/modern-mexicano/lasdoscaras](https://www.huge.co.jp/restaurant/modern-mexicano/lasdoscaras)\n\n**#Shibuya/ Omoetasando area**\n\nRice Hack** - **I didn't make it here until my very last day in Tokyo, and trekked here for some plane food. I had the plain tomato sauce and basil pizza (I can't do cow's cheese) and the baguette, both of which were really great texture, and, were also perfect for plane food! There were plain buns and curry buns, at 10am, which is when they opened, but you could see they were putting out more product as it came out of the oven, so it is hit or miss what you will find. It is a take away counter only (you can buy a drink at the café next door and eat your food there) but definitely work a stop if you are craving some good, fresh baked goods or pizza on the go.\n* Home | RICE HACK Gluten-Free      Bakery (jimdosite.com)\n\nRubia - this is a newish Japanese-Mexican restaurant in the heart of Shibuya, with a mezcal bar upstairs (that I sadly didn't try). They clearly note on their website that they can easily accommodate dietary restrictions and on the night of it was no issue. The food was well presented, they clearly had made accommodations for my courses, and the interior is calm and modern in style, with an open kitchen. I definitely felt comfortable eating here. Food wise, it was a bit hit or miss taste wise, but, apparently lunch has a really good set menu choice that is very tasty.\n* [https://rubia.co.jp/menu/](https://rubia.co.jp/menu/)\n\n**#Kamakura**\n\nI spent just a day here, and stumbled across Luna Burger - it's vegan, and must be fairly new. The chef looked at my allergy text, and confirmed that the curry was gluten free. He then took care to check if barley was ok as the rice he serves with it has barley. When I said no, he said no problem and went and got plain white rice. Overall I was comfortable with his preparation in the open kitchen, and didn't get sick. The back up option was Cups, as others have mentioned, but I didn't wind up going - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/AxPj2o1NaJoWfpJQ8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AxPj2o1NaJoWfpJQ8)\n\nLuna Burger\n* [https://www.instagram.com/lunaburger_j/](https://www.instagram.com/lunaburger_j/)\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/UEjw6MhoTMoqtoHX7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UEjw6MhoTMoqtoHX7)\n\nKannon Coffee - We also stopped by this very cute place for a coffee - they do have alternative milks as well, and seem to have multiple locations.\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/n9jrFjbdENcyiAxG9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/n9jrFjbdENcyiAxG9)\n* [https://www.kannoncoffee.com/](https://www.kannoncoffee.com/)\n\n**#MtFuji area**\n\nWe also just did a day trip here, and wound up eating onigiri, but that was because the one option was too far, and the other one was closed that day!

    "Title": "**#Gifu Prefecture**\n\n***Post 4 of 5***\n\nThis was the second hardest area to find food during my travels - other than in Takayama! But like Kyushu, very beautiful, more nature, and neat to see another side of Japan.\n\n**#Magome**\n\nI have to say this is a super cute little town (a juku town on the #Nakasendo trail) and was worth the very long trek to get there! It didn't have anywhere that I felt comfortable trying, but, I also just didn't try, given the timing of my day. I did try the following:\n\nHill Billy Coffee\n* Cute little place closer to the      start or bottom of the hill. I had a really lovely matcha latte - and they      had soy milk!!\n   * @hillbilly_coffee_roasters (on       instagram\n   * [https://maps.app.goo.gl/r7H6w72HCA2awcAAA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r7H6w72HCA2awcAAA)\n\nKamiogiya Shoten\n* I also bought some (confirmed      100% GF) sake from the lovely owner of a store at the top of the hill of      Magome juku. I had time to kill and he shared some info about the      different types of sake, and clearly pointed out which one's were not GF/      had barley.\n   * Kamiogiya Shoten - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/aVYxR9PwTUdZmYCx5](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aVYxR9PwTUdZmYCx5)\n\n**#Nakatsugawa**\n\nI didn’t spend much time here - I just grabbed onigiri from a konbini for a quick snack. I did check out the historic area of the town (it is also a juku town, on the #Nakasendo trail) and found a beautifully housed sake brewery for a quick tasting (again, used my allergy text to confirm 100% GF)\n* Hazama      Sake Brewery\n* [https://maps.app.goo.gl/BtWPLEJpsjKuEKBV6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/BtWPLEJpsjKuEKBV6)\n\n**#Gero** is an onsen town, and I wound up here as I couldn’t manage to get to Takayama in the same day. I wouldn't have spent the night otherwise.\n\nI stayed at Hotel Sumeikan, which is quite a big property on the river. It's a bit faded glory :-) but it has 3 separate onsen areas, which were nice to relax in. The hotel did have their European restaurant that could do GF dinner but it was pricey at 10,000 Yen. Breakfast was buffet and well labelled, but other than the plain rice and fruit, there was no GF options that I felt were safe from cross contamination.\n\nOm Ganesh - dinner in Gero was limited. I googled and found an Indian, debating between that and one of the izakayas that served Hida beef bbq. Very friendly staff (owners?) who seemed confident there was no gluten in their curry, and I just left it at that and didn't ask further. I didn’t have a reaction, but I am not 100% certain that there was no cross contamination risk.\n* Om Ganesh - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/vx8G3A3F53GZ9jUk9](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vx8G3A3F53GZ9jUk9)\n\n**#Takayama.** How on earth are there so many good options in a such a small town! In my two nights I didn't get to try them all. Do be aware that most of the places do close between lunch and dinner.\n\nHeianraku -\n* As others have said, it was      amazing. Go here. Such a great experience, lovely lovely husband and wife      hosts, super tasty food, really reasonably priced! Everything but one item      on the menu is gluten free, and they take absolute care to provide a safe      gluten free environment. I cannot recommend this place enough! Do book      ahead (via email) as they only take a few tables per night.\n   * [https://heianraku.com/](https://heianraku.com/)\n\nSakura-jaja\n* this one didn't pop up except      for in older posts (until a recent one the other day) but I also really      enjoyed this experience and am so glad I decided to try this one out. It      is a bit further out of town, but worth the walk if you can get a table -      you can only do this by calling direct (I had my hotel call) - as it also      has limited seating. The owner (and chef) is definitely a personality :-)      He entertains his guests while he cooks behind the bar, while his super      lovely, super tiny mother clears and serves the delicious and beautifully      plated dishes he creates.\n   * [https://maps.app.goo.gl/ECtcAX2SzkDWXgX78](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ECtcAX2SzkDWXgX78)\n\nRoyal Nan House Takayama\n* I wound up here as I needed      lunch and none of the other options were open. It was a filling and tasted      good, and I didn't get sick. Same      as in Gero though, there is definitely possible cross contamination here.\n   * [https://maps.app.goo.gl/YWFA5Vja2taieaqj8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YWFA5Vja2taieaqj8)\n\nFalo Coffee brewers -\n* this is a little coffee shop at      the top of town (away from the river) that has really good coffee. They      also have soy milk (and Bon Soy as well!) which was a win for me! They do      also have some baked goods and small breakfast items that are made with      oats, so if you can tolerate oats, you'll be good - unfortunately I'm not      so I couldn't try.\n   * On instagram:       falo_coffee_brewers\n   * [https://maps.app.goo.gl/B5Vb2rAoUGqw8QqEA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B5Vb2rAoUGqw8QqEA)\n\nThis place was mentioned and I tried it out - they are yummy :-) It's this little dessert shop that is open during the morning market on the river. They are somewhat like a roasted marshmallow, and they say on the sign gluten free.\n* おわら玉天 is      the name of the shop but check the google link and you can see what the      front of the shop looks like and save to your maps! - [https://maps.app.goo.gl/y6uKXs9z18VVKebT8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/y6uKXs9z18VVKebT8)\n\nSake tasting - Harada Sake Brewery -\n* I did the (self paced) tasting at this sake house, after having confirmed if all the sake was 100% GF ( I      used my allergy card here as well) with the ladies who sell you your own      sake cup for the tasting.\n   * [https://maps.app.goo.gl/euBiYmPhzrGCEhPn6](https://maps.app.goo.gl/euBiYmPhzrGCEhPn6)\n\nIf you're walking to the Hida Folk Village\n* Starbucks is on that side of the train tracks      and of course has all the alternative milks, which I took advantage of to      combat a mid afternoon energy dip!\n* I did pass this place while walking up, that I didn’t get to try and hadn't seen mentioned before\n   * Fudo - has soy milk (though were sold out the day I was there!) and gluten free treats (though I didn’t investigate up       close) and their menu looks very adaptable\n      * [https://maps.app.goo.gl/nhX2TXPv2YWddNTD7](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nhX2TXPv2YWddNTD7)\n      * [https://www.fudo-restaurant.com/](https://www.fudo-restaurant.com/)",

If you are planning to go to usj or Disney they do have an allergy friendly meal..a lot of people have posted about...but you can do a search and see lots more info. If you get stuck you can buy salted onigiri at 711 or Lawson's... allergy friendly meals are available at moss burger(see the recent post) and ichibanya curry house all kept separate and coeliac safe. \n\nFinally if you get time in Osaka I highly recommend Comeconoco Gluten-free Laboratory & Cafe -米粉専門カフェ 天満橋 Yukiko and the team are amazing. They conduct fabulous cooking classes and have a cafe with some delicious treats..I highly recommend the choux pastry🤤...",

Staff consistently put us at ease with their clear explanations of how the food was prepared. I am very reactive to gluten and had no issues. Also, the brand of hot corn soup and bean sweet in the vending machine next to the bath are gluten free, which is a fun after bath treat! In town is a lovely little shop that sells onsen pudding in lots of flavors and that’s gluten free as well, I didn’t try them but that shop also has gluten free cookies. There’s a well stocked Lawson’s right across the street from the station for snacks and drinks (the Lawson’s stocks Nodogoshi-Nama by Kirin which is a gluten free beer - I have enjoyed a few!).

We went to a bunch of gluten free places or places that offered gluten free but our over all favorites were Avan, RICEHACK, Waco crêpes(Kyoto), and Rizlabo Kitchen. The Find Me GF app was super helpful! I know RICEHACK, Waco, and Rizlabo have been talked about a lot and for good reason the food is amazing! Not only that but the owner of RICEHACK is super kind and thoughtful. We went on our last full day there to get curry buns but unfortunately they had sold out right before we arrived. The owner was kind and felt bad that we would get one more before leaving for home that he offered to sell us one that was set aside for a regular. He insisted that this regular was very understanding and would have no issues with him selling us the bun. I was so unbelievably thankful for that. Now if you made it this far in reading I have a treat for you. If you’re going to be in Shibuya go the Avan! Avan is a dedicated gluten free cafe. It was the best food we came across hands down! The fried chicken almost brought me the tears it was so good. The eggplant spaghetti was also gobbled up so quick lol. And the desserts, they have a variety of churros! This was the first time I was able to try one and I’m so happy I did!Please please please go to Avan and keep them in business. I want to go back and have some more!￼",

This FB group is by itself a godsend with all of our posts and discussion! But if you are specifically looking for someone to help directly during your trip, I definitely recommend them!\nTo say that this company was amazing is an absolute understatement.\nMy husband and I did Japan back in 2014 when I was only a few years into being officially a diagnosed Celiac. Even though it was one of the best trips of my life, travelling in Japan with a gluten allergy was super difficult as you all have experienced – I survived mostly on plain meat and plain white rice as it was very difficult to properly communicate my allergy so it was a very frustrating experience, even with the allergy cards. I wanted to experience the incredible food I was seeing and smelling – its one of the things we know Japan is famous for!\nFast forward to this year when we decided we wanted to go back. I was hesitant from a food perspective, but wondered if with Google Translate now I might be able to get by but would have to spend tons of time trying to figure out if it was safe, if every time I try something should I take the risk etc.\nEnter – Gluten Free Tours Japan. Meaghan and Hiroshi were a GOD SEND. Before the trip they answered every single question I had, learned what I wanted to taste and try (much were fried food that normal people can eat so I was hopeful!), and gathered all of our plans.\nOnce we got there, everything was so simple. They booked tons of delicious experiences for us from Teppanyaki, Omakase, Keiseki, Japanese BBQ, Shabu Shabu and Kushiage. I got to eat SO MUCH – they found me tempura, souffle pancakes, ramen, bread, yatsuhashi, teriyaki, sushi – you name it! My husband is not gluten free and he was able to eat everything he wanted to as well. Anything I came across they were able to help me decipher by checking out any ingredients from the konbini snacks and talk with the chefs and staff directly at any place I had questions – I felt so safe and so taken care of. It was so nice to be able to actually enjoy all the wonderful flavors of Japan without worry and also enjoy the country in a new way!",

    "Title": "I've been living in Japan for almost a decade, and half of which, I've managed to live as a gluten intolerant. I have a sweet tooth, so five years ago, I would always have to bake when I crave or wait for my I-Herb shipping. I moved near the beach side from Tokyo by now, but if you are visiting Enoshima Sea Candle and nearby attractions, Greenstamps Coffee in Tsujido is soooo worth the side trip.\n\nThere are many gluten-free options where I live now in Chigasaki (I guess people associate beach life with healthy life so many cafes have gluten free desserts and options) but it's probably not accessible to those touring Tokyo.\nSo my HUNGER STRIKE plan is below.\n\nI came to Japan with no knowledge of gluten issues, so I ate ALL THE GLUTEN I CAN, so if there are two things only that I miss: IT'S CHOU CREAM (for non-Japan residents, it's basically cream puff on steroids!) and RAMEN/TSUKEMEN (dipping noodles).\n\nOut of the way but if near your itinerary:\nGreenstamps Coffee. The pistachio nama chou cream almost made me cry cause I never thought I could ever eat one again (like cream puffs from Beard Papa which I used to love!)\n\nI know it's not easy to stop by places but here are my you-can-find-anywhere hacks if you have no cross-contamination issues.\n\n1. DOUTOR COFFEE is everywhere. The optimistic in me, always hopes, so I ask and check the ingredient list. For years, everytime I need a quick dessert, I get their BROWN MONT BLANC. (Never the seasonal flavors of murasaki and pumpkin because base is made of tart). The Brown Mont Blanc is made of meringue base and fresh cream. I pair it with black coffee and it instantly makes me happy!\n2. AFURI. Surprise! You can find gluten-free from a chain resto! I've been praying soooo hard for tsukemen that I dreamed it to life. I am not a coeliac and I have low to no reaction to soy sauce. I've eaten the spicy yuzu tsukemen with cold (can be warm) tsukemen konjac noodles many times after a tiring day, and I always feel satisfied and have no reactions. \n3. MARLOWE. Their main branch is in Hayama, where I usually hang out after beach tennis, but they have many stalls across Tokyo. The hopeful in me always asks, so I receive. Haha. Seriously, whenever I tour visiting friends, wherever we are, I always try to discover if maybe something is for me. Marlowe's pudding is cut above the rest. And they have other desserts (financier/cookies/small cakes) that are gluten-free. If I'm not mistaken, made of almond flour. \n4. IKEA. They're accessible in most parts of Japan. Say your family is shopping in Shinjuku, Harajuku or Shibuya, do a stopover. Go to the frozen section. The Daim Almond Cake which is like Ferrero in cake form (with some nougatty, flaky layers) is easy, cheap, and delicious. \n\nShameless plug. More on coffee and beach life than gluten free, but if you want that, too, follow me @coffeee.jp and @beachvintagejapan on Instagram. \nHappy Gluten-free Eating!",

    "Title": "GF in Japan. Oct 2023\n\nA big thanks to this group for all of the advice. \n\nYou’ll need a bottle of GF soy sauce. To find it in a supermarket I needed the picture of the bottle that is on this site (use ‘search’ on this site).\n\nHere are my wins:\n\n**Tokyo**\n\nShimbu Sakiya Ramen. GF &/or vegetarian ramen. Near Shibuya station\n\n**Kawaguchiko**\n\nAlladin Indian restaurant, near the Ogini supermarket. No actual GF menu, but could easily accommodate.\n\n**Magome**\n\nMagome Chaya guest house (G/H). They didn’t get back to me with my email queries re being able to provide a GF meal, so I booked “room only”. On arrival at 3pm the 2 lovely sisters who run the place said “Yes, we can do that”, and OMG! It was divine. I now know that they are so busy providing a top notch service to their guests that my email might have dropped off the bottom of their ‘to do’ list. I would go back there tomorrow!\n\n**Tsumago**\n\nKoshinzuka Minshuku G/H. They assured me in advance that they could do GF meals, and yes! Fabulous. And it’s an old traditional house, with a host who ‘hosts’. Great experience. This place is a little out of town, but we were there for the walking, so it wasn’t a problem. My luggage was transported from Magome to a G/H near to this one.\n\n**Kyoto**\n\nEngine Ramen. fab GF &/or vegetarian ramen.\n\nWaco crepes. SOOOO worth the journey there.\n\nOkonomiyaki Katsu. A tiny ‘cook your own savoury pancake’ place near Ryoanji Goryonoshitacho (historic temple with fabulous rock/sand garden). The proprietor here groaned (nicely) when he read my GF card, then suggested a pork with worchestershire sauce dish. It was amazing! Sorry, I don’t know its name.\n\nMimikou. Udon noodles. Near Chion-in Temple. I mention this as a “not a good experience”. It was mentioned on this site as a safe/good place. I found the staff had no understanding, and struggled to accommodate me. I wasn’t glutened, but my meal was not very nice.\n\n**Hongu**\n\nEngawa Cafe and Guesthouse. No cafe now, just 1 room for guests. This is a very modest/rustic family home. The family have a ‘tread lightly on the earth’ philosophy. There is a great outdoor bath, and a host (the father) who understands GF. He picks you up / drops you off in Hongu. Be warned: composting toilet here.\n\n**Zao Onsen**\n\nKasheru. Owned and ran by a young Sobanoodle chef. No GF menu but a good understanding of what I could not eat. Grilled veges and lamb, lovely sake, and GF miso soup (so good I had seconds of this). They are cash only.\n\n**Takayama**\n\nHeianraku. Needs no introduction to this site. Totally wow! It is worth the effort to secure a booking, through their website [https://heianraku.com/](https://heianraku.com/)\n\n**Yamagata**\n\nTheatre side cafe Slow Jam. Bit of a hit and miss with the staff (like everywhere). I went here twice. The waitress on the first visit was all over the GF thing, and said everything on the menu could be GF. She showed me their bottle of GF soy sauce. I had the Khao man gai.      Next day, different waitress. She was unsure, so I had the Khao man gai again.\n\n**Sendai**\n\nHealthy hut. A wonderful GF enclave in Sendai. Great owner and staff. You feel safe here (re gluten).\n\n**Hiraizumi**\n\nYakiniku restaurant/ pub. No GF menu, but a great waitress/ barmaid who took the time to understand and ‘protect’ me from gluten. Great experience here, no other westerners here, the locals took us under their wings and were gorgeous.",

Gluten free travel in Japan is possible with lots of research and planning. \n\nI started planning about 3 months out. And booked as many restaurants as I could 4-6 weeks out. I diarised restaurants that could be booked closer to the date. I recommend booking as many restaurants as possible. If a restaurant is too busy they won’t seat you. Also we tried showing the translation card to\na few restaurants and it was a no. \n\nI found restaurants by searching this group. Then I short listed restaurants and matched them to attractions. Tokyo is a huge city. Makes it so much easier to eat in areas you already plan to be. \n\nMy husband and I stayed with a friend in Tokyo. Our friend could speak a little Japanese which helped. \n\nI didn’t have any reactions and I took Gluteguard before every meal. I am not a sensitive coeliac. I don’t have reactions from shared fryers or shared hot plates. I will have reactions from same chopping board, utensils or dirty hands. \n\nSnacks\nOnigiri- convenience stores with red salmon and salt. Used my own soy sauce. Definitely for when lunch hasn’t gone to plan. \nBrought my own soy sauce and snacks (rice crackers, museli bars, GF Tim tams, GF Kit Kats, GF tiny teddies, GF Pringles, GF lollies, GF noodles). Good to be able to have snacks as needed. Most snacks in Japan contained gluten. Also I often didn’t have time to google translate snacks.\nWe were walking about 19-24kms per day so I was definitely hungrier than normal. \n\nLaduree Kyoto- GF macarons. Lady in the shop was super helpful and showed me the ingredients list for the macrons. \n\nBreakfast- I brought GF Muesli bars, which was an easy breakfast. Got a little sick of them after a few days. Wish I had brought some GF cereal or muesli. I did find some haloumi towards the end, so was able to make eggs, haloumi and avocado. If you go to Rice Hack (GF bakery) stock up on GF bread. \n\nI managed to have GF churros from Kuroboshi (Asakusa Riki Street) near Senso-Ji temple, definitely recommend. Was delicious and a long time since I have had churros. \n\nTotti Candy Factory, Fairy Floss (Harajuku). Also delicious. \n\nTokyo \nUdatsu sushi- very memorable lunch. Not cheap but worth the $. Lunch is half the price of dinner. Book in advance and request gluten free. Adapted the meal for me. Chef makes the nigiri in front of you he was good a preventing cross contamination and washed his hands regularly. He would make mine first. You can bring your own soy sauce. \nHakkido Sapporo/\nShimbu Sakiya Ramen- Delicious GF ramen and fried chicken. They also had goza but I didn’t try these. Cheap, quick and easy. No bookings. You order on a vending machine and need to pay in cash. Was an absolute treat, I have not had ramen in a very long time. The noodles were so good, was a little worried but my noodles were different from my husbands. The signs inside the restaurant indicated that there could be cross contamination with the fried chicken. I ate the fried chicken and did not have any reaction. Just something to consider for sensitive celiacs. The gluten eaters also enjoyed this place. \nSoranoiro nippon- a little hard to find. But eventually found it. You need to purchase your meal at the vending machine and then join the waiting line. You need cash. GF ramen option is on the vending machine. We waited about 25 mins. Was delicious, poached chicken, egg, brown rice noodles and broth full of flavour. \nOtsuna- sushi- delicious dinner. On the pricey side, but worth it for the high quality. Restaurant even had GF soy sauce, the chef told me it’s hard to find in Japan. Meal was adapted for me, the eel course was substituted. I booked this restaurant in advance. \nRicehack-delicious GF curry puffs. They also have bread and pizza. Close to Harajuku and kaleidoscope escalator. \nGonpachi Nishi-Azabu- I had some chicken and mushrooms skewers and a tempura prawn and rice bowl. They served the tempura rice bowl with matcha salt. I brought my own GF soy sauce to use. A little confusion to start but after I showed the translation card and GF menu from the Asakusa restaurant the waiter talked me through what I could have. All delicious. Fun vibes, 90s music and we were treated to a drum show. Felt my requirements were taken seriously. My food come out separately to the rest of the group. I booked this restaurant in advance. \nKazu (Oshiage)-Japanese bbq place. So much fun. Explained gluten free when we arrived. We just ordered meat with salt ( no soy sauce). I brought my own soy sauce. You cook everything yourself. The hot plate had been cleaned. We also ordered vegetables and rice. I booked this restaurant in advance. \nGluten free T’s- okay. Food is pretty average. Was nice not to have to worry about how the food is cooked and having to explain what wheat is. Definitely good for sensitive celiacs. I booked this restaurant in advance. \nTeppan Baby- delicious, I had an GF Okonomiyaki and cheese teppanyaki. The menu labels items GF. There was a cross contamination risk on the teppan, so I wouldn’t recommend for a sensitive coeliac. I booked this restaurant in advance. \nTorikizoku- chain skewer place in Japan. My friend was able to look up the menu online which specified which items contained wheat. We ordered skewers that were wheat free. I brought my own soy sauce. Good value for money. Was a fun evening. I booked this restaurant in advance. \nVege Herb Saga- vegetarian Indian restaurant, I had a masala dosa. Indian food is a go to takeaway at home as lots of GF options. So was good to find one in Japan. \n\nKyoto \nFish market- beef skewers with salt. \nKikyo sushi- well worth the train ride. Delicious sushi and sashimi. They have gluten free soy sauce. Good English and seemed knowledgeable. Family run. Good price for the quality. \nLoco chicken- chicken is coated in rice flour. Chips are not GF. But chicken is GF and juicy. GF sauces are labelled. You can also get a meal with sides. We just got fried chicken and sauces. Small restaurant with only 4 seats. We didn’t have a booking, just walked in on a Tuesday lunchtime. \nPark Hyatt Kyoto- celebrated our first wedding anniversary at Yasaka. Amazing. Food was delicious and the views. The only course that was different to my husbands was dessert. Restaurant couldn’t guarantee cross contamination. But I wasn’t worried when I got there as only my dessert was different. And my dessert wasn’t cooked on the teppan plate. They were cleaning the teppan plate throughout dinner service. The teppan plate was very clean and ordered. We also had a drink at the bar next door, called Kohaku. Was an expensive experience but worth it to us. \nYosiya - I had the GF/ Vegan bento. I enjoyed the tempera and the tofu and rice. My husband had eel on rice which he enjoyed. Service was bad I waited 35 mins for my lunch and my husband waited 45 mins. Our first drinks also took 30 mins to come. I wouldn’t go out of my way to come here but if you’re going to be in the bamboo forest it’s not too far away. Not sure about cross contamination. I didn’t have a reaction but when I booked they did say they couldn’t guarantee cross contamination so I wouldn’t recommend for sensitive coeliac. \nSugar Hill- I had the chicken teriyaki and it was delicious. They had a few GF options on the menu. I would definitely go back. Wait staff and chef were all very friendly. Also have GF soy sauce. \n\nTeuchi Toru Soba- wanted to go here, but it was closed on a day a few weeks ago it said it was open. \n\nHope this helps. Really enjoyed our trip. Did get a little sad as I couldn’t eat whatever I wanted. But focused on all the delicious food I could have. \n\nFor more photos you can check out my Instagram- travel_and_eating_as_a_celiac",

    "Title": "Hello! I’m a newer member here and I am SO grateful for this group! I’ve been heavily relying on this FB community as we’ve been traveling through Japan.\n\nI’ve tried a lot of the recommendations mentioned in this group (delicious!) and wanted to add an amazing experience I just had tonight at Oh! Teppanyaki Restaurant in Osaka.\n\nA little about me: I have celiac disease and have about medium-high sensitivity to cross-contamination.\n\nBack story: My daughter and I went to Genji-Soba last night for the second time because we loved it so much. My husband and son were craving meat and stumbled upon Oh! as they were wandering around. They had a fantastic dinner there, consuming the best wagyu and Kobe beef teppanyaki they’ve ever had in their lives. They had such a great experience that they made a reservation for our family for the following evening. \n\nAt first, I was a bit weary of the idea because teppanyaki back where we live usually involves marinated meats and lots of sauces. And I was worried about cross-contamination. But my husband felt confident that the chef would be able to accommodate to my dietary needs. And because it was going to be the same chef serving us tonight, he wanted me to try it.\n\nI showed the chef and the server my translation card and we communicated back and forth via Google Translate. They wrote, “We will make sure we will accommodate to your dietary needs and be extra careful as we prepare your meal!” I legit wanted to cry because I felt so seen. 😭\n\nWe ordered from the set menu and they served me the following:\n- salad without dressing, but with olive oil and salt on the side \n- cooked teppanyaki beef without adding sauces, just salt and pepper. DELICIOUS!!\n- cooked veggies with salt and pepper\n- sautéed bean sprouts with oil and salt for me, and the chef added the ponzu sauce into the individual serving bowls for my fam so that the cooking surface didn’t have sauce on it \n- lastly, fried rice without sauce for me (I added some tamari to it and it was amazing). He then cooked fried rice with soy sauce for the fam on the cooking surface since it was the last item in our set menu.\n\nWhile all this was happening, the other chef came by to observe and see how our chef was accommodating to my GF diet so that he could also learn more about it. 🥰\n\nI know this post turned out to be awfully long, but I just wanted to give a special shoutout to the chef, Keshiro, and the staff at Oh! for going above and beyond tonight. Here’s the location if you’re ever craving kobe beef tepppanyaki! Cheers! \n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/MtKUgGfNAGSaRpMaA?g_st=ic",

They had gluten free soy sauce for us and the lady’s father, a lovely gentleman, was the chef who made the sushi in front of us. Plus they had self-made delicious gluten free miso soup. 🙂 Good food and most important, I felt safe eating it. (First sushi I’ve had in a two weeks trip by the way, loved it!) \n\nAddress: 1 Chome-27 Central, Matsumoto, Nagano \n\nAnother recommendation in Matsumoto: Organic Food and Music -restaurant. Small nice vegetarian place. Again, after showing my gluten free card, the lady could prepare warm onigiris and a salad for me.

Everything is gluten free except some buns they cook separately. They also mark the allergens on the menu and take care to prepare things separately and I believe everything is home made. A lot of the food was nut free as well, which is great because I have a tree nut allergy. Unfortunately I think I am an asymptomatic coeliac, so can't advise if you will react, but I was confident in their precautions.\n\nThe staff were knowledgeable and really nice and even gave us recommendations for Kyoto and Takayama and some cookies for free. At night it has a cozy, fancy yet not too formal vibe - would be a great date night if you get the set menu like we did. It also wasn't busy at all when we went - for a while it was just us in the restaurant. Will note it is not cheap by Japan standards, but the food is very high quality and delicious - best we have had so far. Non-coeliac partner was very impressed, including with the vegan items we got.\n\nSo we ordered the set menu. We got lotus chips, spicy edamame, snow crab and avocado on little rice cakes, sweet potato potash soup, eggplant yakiniku with rice and vegetables, mushroom tempura with yuzu dipping sauce and rice and vegetables, hot yuzu and ginger drink, kanazawa parfait with yuzu and berry ice cream and fruit and coconut cream.

Yesterday I ate lunch at Healthy Hut in Sendai and enjoyed it, all good (gf marked meals, search this forum for more details). \n\nMy Japanese friend asked about soy sauce during a long conversation and was told that Japanese doctor/s tell their coeliac patients that they can eat soy sauce. It was noted that foreigners may have different sensitivities and it was not any sort of recommendation. I had just heard previously that some people normally sensitive to any gluten had been able to take soy sauce in Korea and possibly Japan without a reaction. A smaller number couldn't. \n\nI guess I'd like to know more about the source of wheat used by various manufacturers, the processes undertaken in production and whether they are different for any products available in western countries. Is soy sauce the same everywhere is the question....... The next 'pie in the sky' wish is for various types of soy sauce to be actually extensively tested for gluten so we'd know. Any likely PhD candidates out there? :-)",

Also the train service doesn’t run as many places like in Tokyo. Kyoto requires more planning and I would definitely have a back up plan. \n\nOku-no-Niwa: They have one gluten free option which is a traditional Japanese plate. We came here on a Sunday around 12:30 and it was sold out. Have a plan B because there really aren’t any other options in the area for gluten free food (Arashiyama area). There is a cafe at the base of monkey park that’s 100% gluten free and vegan but has only sweets. However, I saw a post somewhere that they also have a cafe in a separate location nearby that has gluten free options, but I did not confirm this. Ended up walking to 7-Eleven for the usual rice ball, egg and fruit. \n\nCafe Maru- The bar menu is all that is available now. It’s 100% gluten free but there are limited options. Very good food! \n\nSugarhill: I would recommend a reservation. While sitting there we saw a few groups get seated and a few were turned away so it depends on luck if you don’t reserve. I reserved about a week in advance using Instagram messenger. The staff all speak good English and they are good with all allergens. \n\nWaco Crepes: DO NOT miss this place! So so good! Everything is gluten free and also everything can be made dairy free. They speak English and are lovely people! \n\nKyoto Engine Ramen: The broth here is a creamy broth which is really good, but heavy. Staff speaks good English. They can do any ramen with gluten free noodles. \n\nHere Cafe: At the base of Kiyomizu-dera. Has a gluten free matcha omelette. It’s not dairy free so I didn’t try it. \n\nThe city bakery: Has a gluten free muffin made with rice flour. I didn’t try it. They do have soy milk and oat milk for their coffees.",

    "Title": "**LONG POST** - Gluten free restaurants review in #Osaka, #Kyoto, #Nara, #Takayama, #Kanazawa, #Tokyo.\n\nFirst of all, appreciation message to this amazing community that allowed me to prepare our Japan trip with lots of pre-saved places which was a massive help in day planning during our 2 week stay in Japan. Also very appreciated all people mentioning #gluten in Google reviews.\n\nFYI, we are a couple on a honeymoon and I can eat gluten but my wife was diagnosed with coeliac desease 3 years ago. We used to be super picky with restaurants and meals before diagnosis (we still are) so I will be very honest with all reviews below. Even though it is highly appreciated to have a restaurant with GF options, it doesn't mean it is automatically a good restaurant.\n\nA few thoughts before jumping into reviews:\n\n**1.** What we found more frustrating is not being able to step in all these lovely small izakayas that you constantly pass by when walking around the cities. Actually 80% of restaurants reviewed had a clear western attendance, so it kinds of water down the purely Japanese experience.\n\n**2. **Breakfast are impossible to manage for a GF individual, actually difficult to manage for a gluten one since most bakeries open around 10.00 so practically all breakfast were from konbini's or fresh fruits from bigger supermarkets. Take advantage to buy bread and similar stuff for next days if you step by a GF bakery (several ones mentioned below).\n\n**3. **Eating GF requires planning, you cannot avoid that and you better have a look at what needs to be reserved or not. Most of reservations can be done with 3-4 days in advance so do not get crazy reserving with months in advance. However, cancellations are frequent so show up to a place that seems fully booked as we were successful in a few places doing that.\n\n**4.** Final thought, GF experience in Japan is not completely the same in culinary terms (bear that in mind) but we still managed to eat a lot of different tasty foods so do not be afraid to go Japan if you are coeliac, you will have an amazing time and 100% sure you will not be hungry. Btw, God bless Google Lens and Google translate.\n\n**RESTAURANT REVIEW **(I had a longer list but only mentioning the ones we actually ate at)\n\n**#Osaka**:\n\n**- Genji soba**:\n\nFirst meal in Japan so quite excited for it but an average experience since main chef was out for 1-week travel and gluten free noodles were not available, only rice + meat bowls. I guess we had bad luck but still very valid option as it is near Dotonbori/Namba and seems quite safe for a coeliac.\n\n**Reservation**: I don't think it is needed (only another couple having dinner on a Wednesday) but place is quite small.\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/pjavzS6mHNbFEGbn7\n\n**- OKO Okonomiyaki:**\n\nSuper well known place in gluten free /vegan community, a must go for location and menu options. However, long lines are a bit frustrating (go early or go late) and you will go out with a strong food smell in your clothes. Food quality is pretty good so I would repeat for an informal dinner.\n\n**Reservation**: not allowed.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/mxrUfPqm37mQ37dN8\n\n**- Matsusakagyu Yakiniku**\n\nWe wanted to try some beef in Kainiku style so we went to this place (branch with several restaurants in Japan) as I read some gluten mentions in Google reviews. Beef was delicious but super expensive in my opinion (19k yen only beef menu, drinks and sides on top), so it may be better to go with a cheaper menu. Also note most of appetizers and sides are not gluten free. Decent option to eat some beef as they were aware of gluten and spoke some English.\n\n**Reservation**: can be done through website but we walk in without it and was half empty. They have private dining booths which make experience quite cozy.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/VCdUadsqvjhPPCRe6\n\n**#Kyoto**:\n\n- **Gion** **Soy Milk Ramen**\n\nVegan ramen place in old Gion district. Their ramen tastes VERY different to a regular ramen that you may have in another place. We didn't like it at all, I would not repeat it since Engine Ramen has also gluten free ramen and is muuuch better flavor-wise.\n\n**Reservation**: not sure if can be done, we went for a lunch in a weekday and no waiting at all.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/AtdLvWypfi8YNFrR8\n\n**- ジビエ・活川魚料理**\n\nThis was one of the most Japanese experiences that we had. It is run by a man that only speaks Japanese but has a device translating English or other languages to Japanese and vice versa so easy to manage. He had several gluten free options and all quite tasty to be honest. Soba's were very good and some charcoal fishes were available too.\n\n**Reservation**: not needed for dinner, maybe needed for lunch. However as place is small, I may recommend stepping in if you are around the area and make a reservation for later on or following day just to make sure.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/R4vBZ8TPnEh5ztB28\n\n- **Kikyo sushi**\n\nStill dreaming about this sushi. Fresh generous fish cuts for a memorable omakase experience. It is run by a family in a traditional way but their son speaks English which makes it easy to understand each other. We thought it was actually cheap for the high quality of food delivered. Gluten free soy sauce available too.\n\n**Reservation**: make a reservation in advanced to not miss out this place - their website has instructions on how to book. We were not in time for reservations so we went early to have lunch on a weekday and it seems it is common for them to have late cancellations so we just had to wait 15 min and had our place at the counter. Can't recommend it enough.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/4s7jx6iZGNBWzpCQ8\n\n**- Engine Ramen**\n\nAnother gem in Kyoto for coeliacs as ramen is very tasty, mentioned several times here so not going to repeat myself. Only downside is it looks like you are in a London/NY spot since everyone there is western, even staff running the restaurant.\n\n**Reservation**: I don't think it is allowed, we went quite early for dinner and we didn't have to wait but there was a waiting line when we went out. However, I think line shouldn't be too long since it is a fast meal.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/woN2N5KZJ5N83h5Y7\n\n**- Ikkakuju Karasuma**\n\nBest Okonomiyaki we had in a 2-week Japan travel. Oyster and special beef Okonomiyakis were to die for and tofu appetizer was tasty as well. They publicly state that Okonomiyakis are gluten free but we are afraid that some cross contamination may exist since they only have 1 big griddle to make them and there are normal/gluten free options. My wife didn't feel bad after the meal and it looked like a clean kitchen but you may want to ask if you are very sensitive to gluten contamination.\n\n**Reservation**: it didn't look like a packed place but it can be easily done though their website so it may be better to assure your seats.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/9Ewbh3XHcp3bWLPH9\n\n- **Toshoan** (bakery)\n\nFancy sweet place near Nijo Castle, all gluten free with multiple options to eat in the place or to take out. A bit pricey but options like pancakes are very tasty.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/GWgZZVGN6x5D6ZSG6\n\n**#Nara**:\n\n**- Big Mountain Cafe & Farm**\n\nNara was a hard spot to find decent gluten free restaurants. After failing with Nino (Italian restaurant offering gluten free pasta but fully booked when waking by and no GF pasta available on that day :/) we had to do a quick research and ended up at a Hawaiian restaurant a bit far away from Nara park and surroundings. Good food, nice desserts and cozy atmosphere. Other options in Nara seemed to be indians or curries so this one looked healthier.\n\n**Reservation**: not needed, place at half capacity on a Sunday lunch.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/MSocF7VXTTmeuJ2k6\n\n- **Nakatanidou** (mochis)\n\nSuper famous place near Nara park were original old recipe mochis are made. You will easily spot it as there are always queues to get a mochi and they do a mochi demonstration at some hours during the day (even more crowded). However don't feel intimidated as they deliver super fast and these mochis are incredibly good, not specially sweet since it is the original bean recipe but we absolutely loved it. And gluten free!\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/iPhdPLpWAi7zyeMA6\n\n**#Takayama**:\n\n- **Suzuya**\n\nBeef restaurants are usually a safe place for a celiac so we went to Suzuya and quite satisfied with quality and price of the food. Not a surprise what you will find there but they are knowledgeable of gluten and have several options for it so highly recommended to go.\n\n**Reservation**: I would say not needed since we didn't have any problem on a lunch weekday. However, it may be recommended to step in if you are already in Takayama to book for a later hour/day.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/Bvvd9H4N4uMF9B2c6\n\n**- Heianraku**\n\nThis place has highly rated reviews in Google and has been mentioned here as a superb place many times, I thought people were exaggerating but NOT AT ALL. What a wonderful place to eat! One of the best meals of our trip. It is run by an old couple that makes you feel very welcome since you step into their place. Food was outstanding, all was very good but mabo tofu... I never thought a tofu dish could have such flavour. On top of that, price is actually cheap which it felt like we were stealing them. GO.\n\n**Reservation**: absolutely needed, I actually think they only work through reservation as they take a very few people on each dinner slot. I got some email from their website so I interacted with them through email with no problems at all.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/Bvvd9H4N4uMF9B2c6\n\n- **Sakurajaya**\n\nIt must be a nice place looking at their reviews but it was a huge disappointment in our trip. No website or booking place is provided to ask for a reservation (other than a phone number) so we walked there to book seats to have lunch on the next day. Once at the restaurant, we found out they recently changed their policy and now lunch time is only accepting local Japanese customers.. which is quite funny since I guess he will ask for the ID or only accept you if you speak Japanese and look Asian. We found this policy utterly discriminatory so I cannot recommend it.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/Aw9QuH6xdB6HXZi86\n\n**- Sushi-Dining Nob**\n\nDecent sushi at a reasonable price in Takayama center where we ended up after Sakurajaya refusal. Not the best quality since they have lots of rolls with avocados and some sauces (like western sushi delivery style) but it tastes quite good and the guy knows about gluten. Gluten free soy sauce available too.\n\n**Reservation**: I don't even think it is allowed. We went at a peak hour for a lunch (12.45h) and we were accepted after waiting 15 min.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/iT7YChbhdVfGoduy8\n\n**- Hidatei Hanaougi **(lodge)\n\nNot actually a restaurant but a Ryokan lodge that we stayed in. Quite expensive but absolutely worth it to have a private onsen in a traditional Japanese room. They include a private dinner and breakfast. Dinner can be highly adapted to gluten free requirements and it is presented in a Kaiseki way with many small dishes. Breakfast as gluten free options differed widely to a regular option since it is directly a western style (pancakes, coffee, etc.), still worth it IMO.\n\n**Reservation**: needed and very much in advanced to secure a nice room with a private onsen in a small garden.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/KAUBrB68J2qv6s4v7\n\n**#Kanazawa**:\n\n**- Omicho Market**\n\nTouristic place in Kanazawa where they sell fresh fish and all types of seafood. You can either take it directly from the stands (safe option asking for no dressings) or go to some of the restaurants in it to have a full plate of sashimi with rice. This second option is better to have a full meal but more difficult to manage since most of the places don't speak English and we only managed to get a meal after talking through Google translate to request no soy or vinegar rice in the bowls. My wife didn't have any issue after eating there but it didn't feel 100% safe - try showing the GF card to several place to assure that.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/TKkmQi4iJ42do9Tb9\n\n**- Fuwari**\n\nAnother highlight of the trip. They actually have a specific gluten free menu which makes it quite easy to order. Sashimi, eel and fish of the day were incredibly good. A bit pricey but food quality makes it absolutely worth it. They also speak decent English.\n\n**Reservation**: recommended or actually needed since dinner time looked with all tables full. Easy to do through their website.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/c7XM35QUkNVDQ7Zn8\n\n**#Tokyo**:\n\n**- Soranoiro Nippon Ramen**\n\nConvenient place in Tokyo Station serving a good GF ramen and outstanding normal ramen. Quite hard to find for the first time, it is located in B1 near Yaesu Central Exit (out of turnstile) in a hallway called Ramen Street.\n\n**Reservation**: not allowed, it has a ticket self service machine but it is usually a short waiting time even if line looks long.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/kqWxZEikdA9D3N7n8\n\n**- Gluten Free Kushiage Su**\n\nAnother highlight meal in our trip. This one is quite an expensive experience since it is a 2-hour private dinner (or lunch in weekends) with the chef in a counter with space for 8 people max. Chef barely speaks English but enough to explain dishes and he will use a translator if there is any additional explanation. Food quality is outstanding and not heavy, even though is it mainly deep fried skewers. Absolutely worth it if you are used to fine dining in your country, not recommended if you are on a budget in Tokyo.\n\n**Reservation**: needed. Easy to do through their website/Instagram.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/bToxSPLSoWMZ2Fms6\n\n- **My Banh Mi **\n\nNice option for a quick meal in Harajuku neighborhood, near Takeshita street. They serve typical Vietnamese banh sandwich with several fillings. It is a bit expensive looking at how small are the portions but still a nice/tasty option in the area. I may recommend to complete it with a pancake in Rizlabo as we did :).\n\n**Reservation**: not needed, it looks more like a take away place.\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/nYyuDJ6d1CVdQoF46\n\n**- Rizlabo **(bakery)\n\nPancakes and sweet place in Harajuku as well. Pancakes are huge and super good so highly recommend it.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/uXQJyr9fokCV3Jdo9\n\n**- Shimbu Sakiya Ramen **\n\nPlace very similar to Soranoiro in Tokyo Station but with more ramen options and even GF gyozas and chicken karagee! Must go if you are in Shibuya since it is not allowed to reserve (ticket machine at the entrance) and it is open until very late in the night. Again, not 100% sure about cross contamination since they disclaim kitchen and utensils used are not different for GF options. However, we went twice with no symptoms.\n\n**Reservation**: not allowed.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/oPQxfK61D3V3Pang9\n\n**- Gonpachi Asakusa**\n\nNice option in Asakusa near Senso-ji temple with views to the river. They have a gluten free menu making it easy to order. Lots of options to choose and quality is ok (not the best) so I would repeat if I am around the area again. Downside is service being super slow as we stayed more than 1h30... They had a big travel group at the same time so this may be the reason.\n\n**Reservation**: people was showing up without reservation but it is easy to do through their website so better do it if you can.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/59F9v1CUPkNoV6t4A\n\n-** Shou Toyosu market**\n\nThis restaurant is next to super famous Sushi Dai which is fully booked for the day before 7.00 am, we didn't even try although we were in the market for the tuna auction at 5.30am. Instead of Dai, we tried out Shou after reading some reviews and it was a marvelous experience. We showed our classical gluten questions to the chef using Google translate and they adapted the omakase menu to GF by not using soy sauce and avoiding a few nigiris like tamagoyaki (kind of egg omelette). Not 100% sure if they were using a rice with a GF rice vinegar but again, my wife didn't feel bad after that. Amazing fish quality.\n\n**Reservation:** not allowed. Check the opening hours as all these market restaurants close quite early (most with last order at 13.30). You may have to wait in a queue for your spot at the counter but nothing crazy.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/h6AUFQCEAmiJvfSL8\n\n**- Breizh Cafe Creperie Shinjuku**\n\nThere are several Breizh crepes restaurants in Japan specialized in french crepes (galettes) offering nice set menus with a wide GF range of salt and sweet crepes. Nice quality of crepes and fillings so it is a safe choice around Shinjuku. Note it is on the 12th floor of a shopping center which may be a bit difficult to find it at the first time.\n\n**Reservation**: not needed, it is quite a big place with indoors and terrace.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/SVqDUoiuHnkvMb1j6\n\n-** FANCL Brown Rice meals**\n\nThis restaurant was an outlier in our trip. Su from Kushiage deep fried recommended us this restaurant in Ginza that I never read about it before. We went there with low expectations and what a surprise! They had a gluten free menu and food quality was outstanding. It is a bit western type of food (pasta, chicken, etc) but lovely cooked and even the other tables were mainly japanese people. They even had GF tiramisu and a small store of staples to buy like bread, cookies, etc. Highly recommend it.\n\n**Reservation**: I would say it is not needed, it doesn't seem a very well known place.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/L31gQkrQDbsXLBQo7\n\n**- Otsuna Sushi**\n\nAnother amazing sushi restaurant very knowledgeable of gluten. They have a weekday lunch menu that is a joke, 1.880 yens for a 10pc nigiri set with miso soup but it is limited to 20 meals per day so you better go early when they open or other menus will be far more expensive. We went later in the day and nigiri menu was considerably more expensive but fish quality was outstanding so we didn't mind to pay for it.\n\n**Reservation**: not needed for lunch, maybe for dinner. 20 meals limitation is first come, first served. As lunch then gets more expensive it was almost empty when we were there. Not sure how packed will be for dinner.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/PgxdaNCrk5r7bycE8\n\n**- NachuRa **(bakery)\n\nBest bakery in our Japan trip, all gluten free. Quite pricey but absolutely worth it.. cheese cake, pistacho cream puff and Mont Blanc were to die for. They also have cookies and similar stuff to be sold for take away. Take a few things with you since it is all super good.\n\nLocation is not the best since it is in Ropppongi but not close to a major touristic spot - around 30 min walk from Ropppongi Hills or Mori Tower.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/jLmFizwhTpKEzqyM8\n\n**- Kuroboshi Churros **(bakery)\n\nNew tiny bakery selling churros close to Asakusa temple. Average quality so unless you are very hungry or desperate for a sweet treat, you may skip that since taste is not great.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/9c93aR7SZ6iE4hJ59\n\nHope you find this large review useful and don't hesitate to ask me questions when preparing your trip to Japan 😊\n\nHope you enjoy as much as we did!!",

He says about 4 weeks of Pimsleur and a single private lesson would have done the trick for the purpose of allergen eating. It has helped us be more confident in what we eat out because he's able to have full conversations about allergens with the staff. It has also significantly helped because during the lesson the teacher was able to say exactly what to expect with what people say and things to say to help them understand. \n\nOf course Google translate can work but the translations are not great once you know Japanese even a bit 🫣 so more chances of miscommunication. \n\nHope this helps someone!",

    "Title": "Hi there! Just returned from a great 2 weeks in Japan,  and wanted to share some insights. I'm a severely reactive celiac that was diagnosed 32 years ago at the age of 2. Safe to say I'm pretty well versed in gluten freedom, so here's how I managed Japan! \n\nNotes up front:\n- Eating gluten free in Japan isn't easy, but it's very possible. Use Google translate on EVERYTHING, do your research beforehand (what words to look out for, what people have already found out is safe, etc), and do not trust anyone without checking yourself or giving them a translated card about celiac. Celiac and gluten allergies are still pretty uncommon in Japan, and the understanding around gluten just doesn't really exist. Have patience and grace, and take care of yourself first and foremost. \n-The hardest part was the social aspect- I couldn't just walk around and find food with my friends. I had to plan my meals for the day, and sometimes just eat what I could. \"Fed is best\" was my mantra, and it helped a lot. \n- I used the Legal Nomads Celiac card (https://legalnomads.gumroad.com/l/GFJapan?layout=profile) and it was essential! It contains a researched translation of what Celiac and gluten are, what ingredients are not safe, and cross contamination details, and everyone responded to it with respect and care. \n- Find Me GF was really helpful, though I generally cross checked with this group to see what was actually good and went to the celiac-reccommended places. \n- Have a glutened-regimine! Accidents happen, and it's important that you have a plan if they do. I got glutened once, and only lost a day to the effects. I brought several things to help me: a probiotic, the gluten ease enzyme pill, turmeric, and fish oil. It helped me bounce back MUCH quicker than normal with manageable side effects that did not completely derail my trip.\n- This group is SO HELPFUL. Search posts for what you need, someone has already shared it!\n\nWHAT I ATE:\nI'm someone that doesn't eat heavy breakfasts, so here's what I did-\n\nBREAKFAST- \nI brought with me 2 weeks worth of Larabars, a jar of peanut butter, a loaf of GF bread, some crackers, soy sauce packets, and Bob's Red Mill instant GF oatmeal (no one bothered me about any of these at customs). I ate a larabar for breakfast, or grabbed Chobani yogurt from the 7-11 for breakfast (sometimes both). Having food on hand for breakfast saved me from having to find food first thing in the day. I usually went out for coffee, and had no problems as long as I stuck to milk and espresso (no flavorings). \n\nSNACKS/LUNCH-\nI would generally plan 1 restaurant meal per day, either for lunch or dinner. That meant finding alternatives for the other meal. I generally preferred dinner out, bc it gave me more time to make other plans. \nI had a host of things I'd eat at the 7-11:\n- salted rice balls\n- pickled plum onigiri\n- edamame\n- deli meat (usually just the packaged ham) \n- cheese slices or triangles \n- Calbee potato sticks (blue package)\n- Chip Star (red package only)\n- microwavable rice meals, including rice and red beans or just plain rice packs. (Sometimes I'd add the meat and cheese to the heated rice packs, good calorie packed meal). \n\nI would also eat leftovers or takeout from the restaurant I went to the day before.\n\nRESTAURANTS -\nAs mentioned, I'd usually try for 1 restaurant or eat out once per day. I rarely made reservations - I just didn't find that most of the places I was going needed it. Honestly, I couldn't really find places that even had reservations! Here's the places I tried:\n#kyoto\n-Gion Soy Milk Ramen (absolutely delicious) https://www.findmeglutenfree.com/biz/uno-yukiko/5561510661849088\n-Sugarhill Kyoto (good hearty meal) https://www.findmeglutenfree.com/biz/sugarhill/6625188896702464\n-Nishiki market- not a specific place, but I handed my Celiac card to a couple vendors and got amazing wafyu beef sticks, just salted. Couldn't find the mochi place some people in the group talked about. \n- Toshoan (really good, but not really a meal- bakery with small pancakes and baked goods, and all sweet, not savory). \nhttps://www.findmeglutenfree.com/biz/toshoan/4862767015264256\n#hiroshima\n- Cafe Ponte (great Italian food, had the risotto and gelato) https://www.findmeglutenfree.com/biz/cafe-ponte/4676846459944960\n#Osaka\n- OKO Fun Okonomiyaki (hilarious experience, really tasty food. Not everything is GF but most is. Takes a lot of time- run by ONE person who takes orders, cooks, etc)\nhttps://www.findmeglutenfree.com/biz/oko-fun-okonomiyaki-bar/6416950664757248\n#Tokyo\n- Gluten Free T's (definitely worth the hype, absolutely delicious) https://www.findmeglutenfree.com/biz/gluten-free-ts-kitchen/5152886006480896\n- Moyan Curry (literally next to our hotel, and some of the best and filling food I had) https://www.findmeglutenfree.com/biz/moyan-curry/5882937810223104\n-RICEHACK bakery (delish pizza, wonderful baked goods, and absolutely worth it) https://www.findmeglutenfree.com/biz/ricehack-onden-house/5242488937906176\n- Plus One - the cafe next to RICE HACK, had a blueberry banana smoothie that was delicious. they don't really have food anymore or GF food.\n- GF Soba Noodle class- this was a private cooking class that my husband and I took that was completely GF and amazing! Ended up eating a lot! https://soba.specialist.co.jp/sobaclass.html#sobaclass \n\nWHERE I STAYED:\nKyoto- Airbnb- it was nice to have a kitchen, but not essential. More essential to have a microwave honestly - we were out so much, that cooking meals wasn't something I had energy for. \n\nNikko- Honke Bankyu Ryokan- this was a pleasant surprise! I didn't think I'd get to experience the kaiseki meals here, because despite their allergen notice in their website, they responded to our emails saying they couldn't change their food or seasonings. On the first night, I gave the server my Celiac card, and they prepared special meals for me every meal after! They were hearty and delicious. https://www.bankyu.co.jp/\n\nTokyo - Hotel Gracery Shinjuku- I didn't bother with the breakfast at the hotel, but the accommodations were lovely and I had a fridge and kettle in my room. http://gracery.com/shinjuku/\n\nI've included some pics for reference, but feel free to comment any questions! Cheers!",

    "Title": "I’m planning to visit Japan for 2 weeks in December.\n\nI’m a sensitive celiac who gets very sick within 30 minutes of having gluten, so I am very careful and rarely take risks, but I do eat out and try to order as safely as possible. I’ve had celiac for 15 years and am sooooo careful.\n\nThat being said…I spent a month in Korea last year and I realized that on several occasions I accidentally ate soy sauce (which is almost impossible to avoid 100%). The strange thing is….I never got sick once in my month there! The first time I realized I accidentally had it, I had a panic attack for hours waiting to be super sick.\n\nI spoke with a friend I met there, who is also celiac and Korean and a researcher in the medical field (this is not her field and she is not claiming fact), and her opinion is that the fermentation process reduces the gluten making it gluten-free, but because testing is only done before the fermentation process (unlike on distilled liquors), soy sauce will never be listed as GF. She said she is also sensitive and has never been sick from soy sauce. \n\n**Please not that this is not fact, just what I was told. Please don’t take this as advice**\n\nFoolishly, I tested this one meal, and dumped this ginger soy sauce side (probably about a 1/4 cup full) into a soup I was eating. This was extremely risky, but I ate it all without issue and never got sick.\n\nSince I’ve been back in the States, I am very careful with soy sauce, eating gluten-free soy sauce, but once in a while…if I’m out at Korean BBQ, I’m pretty sure it’s in some of the sides and again I’ve eaten and not gotten sick.\n\n***So my question is…..has anyone with celiac eaten the soy sauce (and not asked for GF) in Japan without issue? ***\n\nPlease know that I don’t take risks….in Europe, I don’t eat the bread because people say “wheat in Europe is safer”. I don’t believe that at all, and I am super careful. I don’t even let others bake for me because I don’t trust anyone else with cross-contamination.\n\nHowever, I will definitely be bringing GF soy sauce packets with me.",

    "Title": "Going to contribute info over the next few weeks! This group has been so important in my planning ❤️\n\nI've been living on lots of convenience store food, especially for breakfast since not much is open. I'll picture stuff I got. I am not diagnosed celiac, but eat GF for autoimmunity and generally have symptoms of bloating and brain fog when consuming gluten - but have not experienced it here thus far. Also DF generally. Almost all things listed are df. \n\nI'll add in pics of my various breakfast and one dinner haul so far of what I believe has all been GF. I focus a lot on protein. The chicken sausage looking things and salted soft boiled eggs have been surprisingly satisfying. The miso soup was actually pretty yummy too. \n\nTokyo - Matsuya - had their allergen beef bowl (only one gf). Def not impressed but the beef was good. I didn't have sauce with it and it just wasn't very exciting. We got it for the quick convenience. No pic.\n\nAsakusa shopping district, found 2 yummy desserts. Second one was better (the tiny balls from pink paper bakery on the corner on the main street with matcha)\n\nTokyo - Otaco Bakery - AMAZING gf dessert bread. I have tried a lot all over in USA and have never had one this fluffy. Not all are DF, so ask. \n\nTokyo - Kura sushi - we eat here back home in USA and wow the Japan one is so much better! Very unique dishes and they have an allergen guide on their site and in general most nigiri is GF. Def a must go even if you have one where you live. Honestly we might go again. \n\nTokyo - Kirby Cafe - they clearly mark GF, just the caprese and curry. I don't usually like curry but I thought it was delicious. There's also a yummy drink with jelly balls I got. \n\nTokyo - Gonpachi in Asakusa - GF dedicated menu. Everything we had was super delicious. Beautiful view on the 2nd floor. We had a 5:30 reservation and got 2nd floor no problem. \n\nShinjuku Station had these little fish sausage like things. Actually way better than I expected, would buy again. It was across from Becks Coffee. \n\nKawaguchiko - Shaw's Sushi - ate here twice and lived on convenience store food the rest of the time. Delicious sushi with local salmon. You have to get there at opening or a little before to get in line as they sell out quick. I did a tunal bowl for lunch (only thing not sold out, and it was actually pretty good even though I don't usually like tuna) and a salmon bowl for dinner (the one I wanted for lunch!). It comes with salad (lunch had 2 salads), a little dessert (yuzu warabimochi I think), and miso soup. The chicken teriyaki is not GF. I also had gf tempura and GF fried octopus. The tempura was super yummy. \n\nThere are a lot more convenience store options I think but milk protein is added to a lot so I avoid.",

    "Title": "Hello everyone!\n\nI just got back from an incredible trip to Japan and South Korea. My boyfriend and I spent a total of 8 days in Japan (Tokyo, Kyoto, and Osaka) and loved every minute of it. \n\nI was very nervous since this was my first time traveling abroad after being diagnosed w/ celiac ~5 years ago and I had heard that Japan was not gf friendly. However, I ended up having some of the best food of my life on this trip! I am a symptomatic celiac and would 100% know if I had been glutened...and I didn't get sick! This  group, as well as the Find me Gluten Free app (my holy bible), absolutely saved me. I also brought an allergy card for celiac translated into Japanese that I purchased from the Equal Eats website (https://equaleats.com/). This is the #1 thing I recommend doing (...if you don't speak Japanese). Seriously SO helpful to show at restaurants/street food vendors. I bought the downloadable version and had them printed at fedex (much cheaper then ordering the shipping version). \n\nI did LOTS of research before the trip and made an extensive google map w/ pins marking everywhere that I could eat, which was very helpful. I was traveling with my boyfriend who is not gluten free, and he loved all the restaurants we visited!! Also something to note is that we are young travelers and were definitely on the budget tour. I feel that all the spots listed below are budget-friendly, besides Kushiage Su. \n\nHere's where we went in Japan... hope this is helpful! :) \n\n**TOKYO** \n\n**Shimbu Sakiya Ramen (Shibuya) **\n\n2 Chome-10-3 Dogenzaka, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0043, Japan\n* Easy to order outside on the machine, gf options are marked\n* Got the pork & fried chicken spicy miso ramen. Delicious. \n\n**Gluten Free Kushiage Su (Ginza)**\n\nJapan, 〒104-0061 Tokyo, Chuo City, Ginza, 8 Chome−15−2 パークビル 2階\n* Such an incredible experience. I made a reservation through the link on their instagram and dinner ended up  being just me and my boyfriend! \n* 13 course set menu with appetizers, deep fried skewers, and a dessert. Food was insane. This would probably be a $300+ per person set menu in the US, so we felt the price was amazing for the food & service you get. This was definitely the fanciest meal we had on our trip.  \n* The chef speaks very minimal english so we used google translate to communicate \n\n**Rizlabo Kitchen (Shibuya)**\n\n4 Chome-15-2 Jingumae, Shibuya City, Tokyo 150-0001, Japan\n* Great spot for GF fluffy pancakes. Got the strawberry ones and they were amazing.\n* We got there ~15 mins after it opened and there was a pretty long wait \n* Also in a very chic neighborhood. We had fun exploring the area! \n\n**Nabezo Shinjuku Sanchome Store (Shinjuku)**\n\nJapan, 〒160-0022 Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Shinjuku, 3 Chome−30−11, Takano2, 8F\n* Shabu shabu restaurant w/ one gf broth option\n* Our waitress was absolutely amazing and brought over tamari and physically walked me through the entire buffet pointing out what I could & couldn't eat! \n\n**Tsukiji Outer Market**\n* Street food was generally hard throughout the trip, as expected. Painful watching my boyfriend eat everything but Tsukiji market is definitely worth the visit. It was awesome. \n* What I did eat: lotsss of sashimi (brought my own tamari packets) and fresh fruit as well as the sugar-coated fruit!\n\n**Gluten Free T's Kitchen (Roppongi) **\n\n7 Chome-8-5-2F Roppongi, Minato City, Tokyo 106-0032, Japan \n* Everything is gluten free. We got the fried chicken, pork gyoza, french fries, and chicken yakisoba. Yum!\n\n**Moyankare (Moyan Curry) (Shinjuku)**\n\nJapan, 〒160-0021 Tokyo, Shinjuku City, Kabukicho, 1 Chome−12−5, Cherry Bld., 1F\n* Showed the employee my celiac card and he pointed on which curries I could have. Got the ratatouille curry (which was just a veggie curry) and added a soft boiled egg. Super delicious\n* I LOVE spicy food and got a 5 on the spice scale (1-10) and it was superrrr spicy. Fair warning!\n\n**Otsuna Sushi (Roppongi)**\n\nJapan, 〒106-0032 Tokyo, Minato City, Roppongi, 7 Chome−14−4 レム六本木ビル １F\n* We went for the lunch special (amazing deal) at around 1pm but it was sold out so we went back the next day at 11am and boy was it worth it\n* Seriously insane sushi. Couldn't recommend enough. They brought over gf soy sauce and substituted a few non-gf nigiri in the 10-piece lunch special for gf options \n\n**Gonpachi (Asakusa) **\n\nJapan, 〒111-0034 Tokyo, Taito City, Kaminarimon, 2 Chome−1−15 １Ｆ２Ｆ 中川ビル\n* Super cool restaurant w/ a separate gf menu. Got a variety of grilled skewers & shrimp tempura. They asked me if they needed to change the frying oil! \n* A bit on the pricier side for us but very worth it\n\nOther Tokyo spots I had marked but didn't get to visit:\n* Soranoiro Nippon (ramen)\n* Breizh Café & Crêperie (crepes)\n* Ricehack (bakery)\n* Teppan Baby (okonomiyaki)\n\n**KYOTO** \n\n**Kyoto Engine Ramen **\n\n580-2 Nakanocho, Nakagyo Ward, Kyoto, 604-8042, Japan\n* Got the spicy miso chicken ramen w/ gf noodles and it was incredible. Best ramen I had on the trip \n* VERY busy & very touristy so expect a wait. Also it was on the pricer side for ramen \n\n**Loco Chicken **\n\nJapan, 〒600-8018 Kyoto, Shimogyo Ward, Ichinocho, 253-1 河原町会館 101\n* Recommended to us by a fellow celiac traveler who we met at engine ramen. Very small fried chicken restaurant that uses rice flour\n* So good! Everything is gf besides the buns used for the chicken sandwiches and some of the sauces. Menu is labeled w/ gf options \n\n**Kikyo Sushi **\n\nJapan, 〒604-0071 Kyoto, Nakagyo Ward, Daimonjicho, 油小路通丸太町下る43-2 大文字町43\n* We made a reservation here and were super glad we did bc it was very busy \n* Best sushi we had on the trip hands down. Probably the best sushi I've ever had in my life\n* They have gf soy sauce & a menu page explaining whats gf. I got one of their nigiri & roll sets and they substituted non-gf nigiri for whatever I wanted!\n\nOther Kyoto spots I had marked but didn't get to visit:\n* 10 Soba (soba)\n* Gion Soy Milk Ramen (ramen)\n* Waco Crepes (crepes) \n* Sugarhill Kyoto (Japanese fusion)\n\n**OSAKA** \n\n**Genji Soba **\n\n4 Chome-5-8 Nanba, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0076, Japan\n* Super cute small soba restaurant with an option for 100% buckwheat noodles \n* Got the set w/ cold soba & tempura which they boil/fry separately. My part of the meal was pretty expensive (...but definitely worth it)\n\n**Oko - Fun Okonomiyaki Bar **\n\n1 Chome-15-24 Higashishinsaibashi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0083, Japan\n* We got there at 5:40pm (it opens at 6) and were glad we did bc there was a long wait after us \n* So many gf options and the food was amazing! We also loved the DIY bar set-up. Very fun spot. \n\nOsaka spots I didn't make it to:\n* Comeconoco (cafe w/ gf rice bread)\n* Café Morning Box (cafe)\n\nSNACKS/OTHER STUFF\n* What I would get from 7/11/Lawson/Family Mart - salted salmon onigiri, packaged fruit (grapes, bananas, oranges), soyjoy bars, juice, plain pudding \n* Mos Burger - got the hot dog from the allergen menu once. Good safe option if nothing else is around but wouldn't go out of my way for it \n* Alcohol - I drank rice sake & lots of kinds of soju \n* GF soy sauce - I brought individual packets of tamari and was very happy I did! Here are the ones I got on amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XS2P1XG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details\n* Sushi conveyer belts - we really wanted to try one of these and we ended up going to a Sushiro while in Tokyo. I showed an employee my celiac card and she brought it to the kitchen, then a chef came out and told me what I could/couldn't eat. There was a bit of a language barrier, but he told me the vinegar was gluten free, even though I'm not sure he 100% understood what I was asking. We ended up eating at Sushiro twice and I had no reaction at all and it was super fun! I just did not include it above bc I can't guarantee that sushiro in general is safe since it's such a big chain.",

ONLY dinner reservations (6pm-10pm).  I do not know if you were to physically walk up to his restaurant for lunch (11:30am-2pm) if he would turn you away or serve you.\n\n#takayama Heianraku: I emailed for these reservations. The one and only time I decided to ask any Japanese restaurant [prior to arriving in Japan] if they could avoid my other allergens (Sesame and Soy Protein [tofu, mizo]), and they turned me down with, \"It is so difficult for us to provide food. Please look for another restaurant.\"  You're telling me, buddy! 🤣 So, I'm just going to have to bear it all throughout Japan because my Celiac Disease takes precedence over the other (minor) allergies.

So they are happy to accommodate if you bring your cards to communicate with. Though they appear to be able to speak English well enough, they did not understand my question when I asked, I had to use translate to get the point across and salt and pepper is fine.\n\nThe beef they use here is no hormone, not frozen and aged for 30 days. I just ate here and it's fantastic.\n\nI hope this will be of help to you guys.\n\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/HygzxyzmNMXF2UU57",

    "Title": "I'm about to end my 16-day Japan trip and wanted to pass along some advice to the group while my thoughts are fresh! \n\nFirst, this blog was my absolute godsend for planning places to eat: https://www.legalnomads.com/gluten-free/japan/\n\nI would suggest looking up each place and adding it to your Google maps with a special color coded pin so when you're out and about you can pull up your map and see what's close by that you already know to be safe. \n\nSecond, I searched \"gluten free food near me\" in Google maps countless times when there wasn't anything close by that I knew about and it worked really well! Found several gems that way. \n\nThird, using the info in the articles above, make a few reservations at GF restaurants so you know even on a rough day that you'll have a for sure good and safe meal coming up. This really helped preserve my sanity when I was frustrated by a lack of options.\n\nFourth, if you're traveling with people who aren't GF, it's ok to part ways for meals and go on your own lil GF adventure for an hour or two while they enjoy a meal at a place that you may not be able to safely eat. This was way better for me than awkwardly sitting at a place I couldn't eat and I kind of liked the opportunity to just roam on my own a bit, knowing I wasn't holding my husband back from enjoying places he wanted to try too. \n\nFifth, bring some protein bars with you just in case. I got GF nut and chocolate bars from Costco that helped me when I was hungry to not make rash decisions. \n\nLastly, and this may be obvious, but even if you think a food is safe, if the ingredients aren't listed, just ask. I got glutened once from vanilla soft serve of all things and it was awful. From then on, I asked about everything using a GF card in Japanese and everyone was super kind and thorough in making sure they gave me accurate information. \n\nI can honestly say I was able to try every type of traditional Japanese food I am aware of in a gluten free form and had some of the best meals I've ever had in Japan. It is totally doable, it just takes a little planning, so don't let being GF hold you back from some great foodie adventures! Enjoy!",

So I ended up very sick after a few months and really depressed so I looked hard for a doctor who would look me over and as soon as we mentioned celiac disease there were doctors that actually turned us away. They didn’t believe that it existed and hadn’t heard of it so they didn’t even give us the time of day. A few kind doctors tried to understand and one gave me a blood test after some convincing. All in all it was a really disappointing experience and I sure hope that in the big city you can find some affirming doctors for your children!! ♥️",

    "Title": "Hi all! I just spent 2 weeks in Japan (Tokyo & Osaka). I’m gluten free and dairy free and underestimated how hard it would be for me to eat in Japan! Very grateful for this group. Here’s my recommendations in hope they help someone else!\n\nTokyo:\n- RICEHACK GLUTEN FREE BAKERY - Shibuya City - I got the baguette which I ate for the next couple of mornings with a 711 boiled egg. It’s delicious!\n- MY BANH MI BY GLUTEN FREE - Harajuku - so good and fresh. I had the lemongrass Bahn mi. Highly recommend it!\n- BREW PARLOUR 3615 - Chuo City - We had breakfast here 3 days in a row. The best gluten free and vegan pancakes! They also do gluten free and vegan lunch boxes which come with corn bread and rice. I bought the lunch box 3 times, so good! And they also have vending machine! So you can purchase when they’re not open.\n- GLUTEN FREE T’S - recommend booking in advance. Such a good menu for gluten free / vegan / vegetarians. I got the Okonomiyaki, the fried mustard chicken (fav dish!), cherry kombucha and cherry blossom cake. More pricey but really good! They’re also on Uber eats!\n- MEU NOTA - Suginami City - really delicious vegan cafe. The staff don’t speak much English but they read my gluten free card and recommend the spicy coconut curry which was so yummy.\n- CHAYA MACROBIOTICS - Monaro City - lots of vegan options and the staff were able to recommend a gluten free dish which was amazing! Also had a vegan / gluten free cheesecake. \n\nOsaka:\n- FALAFEL SABARA - delicious! The falafel plate without the pita is gluten free. The owner speaks good English and is very kind and helpful. Vegan options too.\n- TAQUERIA LA FONDA - best food I ate in all of Japan. Insanely good! Most of their tacos and their nachos are gluten free. Tacos come without dairy and I just asked for dairy to be left of the nachos. No vegan/vegetarian options though.\n- OKO TAKIYAKI - Delicious okonomiyaki and lots of gluten free and vegan options. It’s a very popular place and we waited in line for maybe 45 minutes so I would recommend arriving as soon as they open and be willing to wait. The food is worth it! Also a note on location: they’ve recently moved google maps will take you to the old location but there is a sign with the new address and it’s only a 3 min walk. \n- CAFE MORNING BOX - expensive but worth it, the best cakes I ate in Japan! Their gluten free banana bread with vegan butter is insane! And the Madeline and choc chip donut \n\nOther:\n- Starbucks - we went to Starbucks almost everyday! They have a gluten free vegan banana muffin and their soy milk is delicious. I got soy milk tea lattes or soy matcha lattes.\n- McDonald’s - when desperate I would get McDonalds fries and a side salad (no dressing)\n\nConvenience Stores/Supermarkets go to’s:\n- #1 favourite was the banana soy milk poppers! I also had the strawberry, matcha, and fig flavours (all good)\n- Pomegranate juice\n- Bananas\n- Onigari (salmon, picked plum or salted rice) - always check the ingredients with google translate though as not all brands are gf\n- Salted boiled eggs \n\nOther tips:\n- If possible book accommodation with a small kitchen. Having a microwave/stovetop is so helpful. We boiled veges and cooked omelettes a lot too.\n- if you search “gluten free” on google maps you will be able to view places that other people have left reviews for mentioning gluten free options\n- google translate and a gluten free travel card we’re saviours!",

    "Title": "Currently on my third visit to Japan. Not coeliac but highly reactive to gluten. Staying in Airbnb apartments or hostels with kitchens. I love the Japanese style of having small serves of fresh delicious foods at supermarkets, suitable for cooking/assembly in apartments with small fridges etc. Trying to make the most of that as we travel. \n\nFor people in a similar situation, here are some examples of my GF experience in my first few days, just in case it helps:\n\n- First day visit to a supermarket with my Google image translate app for a scoping of fresh foods in season and general GF options (early morning so I didn’t get in the way of other customers). Really enjoyed the process. Bought some GF soy sauce, coffee (with filter gadgets), milk, oil, honey, fruit and veg.\n- A breakfast: Greek yoghurt, honey, banana, egg, cucumber.\n- A lunch while roaming fish market and gardens in Kanazawa: sushi, inari, veggie sticks, coffee, yuzu drink, matcha icecream in a cup.\n- A dinner cooked at our accomm using supermarket goodies: grilled ready-made unseasoned chicken and leek skewers, various delicious pickles from the fresh produce section (ginger, turnip, mushroom), microwavable rice, cucumber, ready made omelette, wine, chocolate.\n- A dinner out at a local yakitori restaurant: various meat and vegetable yakitori with sides of daikon salad, pickles, okra with kimchi, and sake. Family Mart crème caramel for dessert.\n\nI hope that helps someone with similar allergies and tastes. I am lucky enough to be able to tolerate cross contamination, albeit with some symptoms. Can definitely recommend finding large supermarkets rather than relying on convenience stores.\n\nEdit: Please note that some foods above have included soy sauce in their preparation, and are therefore not suitable for those with coeliac disease or other complete intolerance to soy sauce. I am fortunate enough to be able to tolerate small amounts, although a wheat cracker will send me to bed for a couple of days so I need to be hyper-vigilant in my own way.",

This comes from a culture that has relied on raw fish for a long time, so all food has to be super fresh! Raw egg is usually only used as a dipping sauce for one or two specific dishes and you’ll know that when you see it. And apparently their eggs don’t have the bacteria that we worry about in the West, which is why they can eat it raw. Meat will also be obvious if it’s raw. As long as you can show any waitress/waiter the word for “pregnant” on your phone (using google translate), then they will take very good care of you. \n\nThe gluten part may be harder, but they will also do their utmost to accommodate you there. I’d probably just stick to the places recommended on this page, or even use the Gluten Free Tours Japan company if you are pregnant by then and don’t want to take any risks with gluten at all.\n\nOverall, people in the food industry in Japan have exceptionally high standards of food hygiene — quite the opposite of the rest of Asia!! \n\nI hope you enjoy your trip. \nCheers from a currently pregnant fellow Coeliac!  \n\nPS My obstetrician said that the only risk if I got glutened during pregnancy would be if I let myself get dehydrated. Other than that, it wouldn’t harm the baby.",

I also see some Indian and yakiniku places which are likely to have gf options.

There was a sign saying that the aeon mall Chu Chu Churros shop was open. So we walked the 10km round trip to fortunately discover they were indeed still open  🙂 thank you so much to this group and all the information. It has been so useful for my trip planning. I am in Shikoku for two months and although I am not coeliac I can only eat very low gluten. I will do a summary post at the end of my trip of the restaurants/ konbini I went to in Shikoku 💕\n\nEdit: one of the chu chu churros shop (the one right near the Tokushima station)  was actually open when we passed through Tokushima again the following week. I think the sign said opening hours 2pm - 6pm. Lucky for me as I got to try the chocolate flavoured churros this time it was delicious!",

    "Title": "Hello! I just got back from Tokyo and wow, 4 fulls days isn’t not even close enough to dip your foot in to see the sights let alone the food options. I had several bad nights of food finding issues because of timing issues (the transportation takes forever!). I can confirm that the Ramen Museum does not have GF options. I learned this hard way and felt so silly because I had read the updated post on it wrong. Also, Soranoiro NIPPON does have GF ramen BUT they were out by the time we got there! 😭 Thankfully at 9:30pm on both failed nights we found options (salad the one night and to go sushi the next). 😩 I was so tired and hungry I failed to get the names of the restaurants. However, Gluten Free T’s and Umaimon Azuma were delicious! I bought the packaged GF ramen Gluten Free T’s sells too! I used the GF card app that another person posted about to eat at other locations and it worked so well. There are so many things I would do differently but being new to not only Tokyo but also being so rusty and green with public transportation made things a bit rocky at times. Also, the 1 day tour trip to Mt. Fuji was very challenging for food and I am glad I brought my own. I did eat the corn on the cob at the 5th station though and it was delicious! \n\nI went to Sankei Gardens and there are several little restaurants in it. I was able to find GF savory mochi at one of them. It wasn’t my favorite but I was able to eat. \n\nA couple of travel tips:\n-don’t stay too far away from the things you want to see or you spend hours on the train/subway/buses (I didn’t have a choice as I was joining my husband ona work trip)\n-buy the Welcome Suica card at the airport. You cannot get them anywhere else is my understanding and it was a game changer. My husband didn’t get one and he had to buy tickets ever time he used transportation. \n-have a plan B and C available. I looked for plan b and c but there were not options. I should have this through better. \n-if you can afford it, use Gluten Free Tours Japan. I wish I would have just spent the money and used them but I thought I could do it on my own. Rookie mistake. Things would have gone a lot smoother if I had. \n\nDisclaimer: I only have an intolerance due to IBS, not celiac. \n\nI hope this helps someone. Thank you for all the posts and assistance here!",

    "Title": "We just returned from our 4 day trip up to Hokkaido, September 9-12 with my (asymptomatic) Celiac kiddo. We stayed at Niseko Hilton based on some posts about Hilton's general GF knowledge compared to most here in Japan and expecting some of the restaurants in the Find Me Gluten Free app to be sufficient.\n\nIn the summer/off season, a lot of places aren't open, like Pirateman and Sanbarco (Sanbaraco? One spelling is in Niseko, though we never found it, the other, which has an IG account, is in Northern Honshu! Don't get confused as we did. lol). We were also turned away from an advised yakiniku restaurant saying they were fully booked, though we had the feeling that was not the reason they turned us away, 5 minutes after opening in a small-ish town in off season..... (unless they only half book in the summer? We drove by later and it was still quite open.).\n\nWe ate at the Taj Mahal Indian restaurant several times. There are several in the area, one is closed in off season. We ended up at the Kutchan location both times. My family loved it. My celiac had the briyani the first time with papad and butter chicken the second time. He is very sensitive to spices and both were very mild and worked well for him. Portions are quite large, though minimal chunks of chicken, far too much for my tiny 9 year old. My younger girls have no dietary restrictions and had the one option of a kids meal which is must smaller portions (my 5 yr old couldn't finish, but my 7 yr old did) but they DO have gluten (it's like a small amount of butter chicken chopped up, side of yellow rice, giant gluten buttered naan, fruit cup, OJ, and elephant toy - so you know in advance if you have a celiac kiddo and non celiac kiddo, be prepared to order a regular OJ and ask them ahead of time not to bring the toy. My son was ok, but we went twice so he ended up with the toy the second time since my daughters didn't need 2 elephants). \n\nWe had breakfast every day at the Hilton and dinner 2 or 3 times. During the off season, only the buffet restaurant is open. At breakfast, there is an omelet station that is safe, plain yogurt with cut fruit, and a cheese and cut meat area, big rice maker of plain rice, steamed, plain potatoes and veggies, salad station, and then of course a random assortment of many other (mostly unsafe) things. I had included in our reservation that my son had celiacs and we would appreciate if any allergies could be noted. They had little allergy signs beside all the food and included gluten. I checked on several items (like cocoa rice krispies) and they seemed to all be accurately marked. Some items, while not gluten free, we could not chance as they were too closely beside gluten items (like the yogurt dry toppings had barley beside the pumpkin seeds and dried fruit, or the GF \"sausage\" was in the same container as the gluten \"bacon\", the tater tots were supposedly safe, though they were probably cooked in the same hot oil as the karaage). \n\nWe did the buffet for him the first day, but that evening for dinner we asked the staff a question about gluten and our server brought over the restaurant manager. We had driven for almost 2 hours trying to find dinner out, before returning to attempt dinner at the hotel. Two hours wasted, we should have gone straight back! Yahata-san was amazing, I almost cried! She seemed very knowledgeable and asked if she could prepare his meal special. She brought so much food, I was astounded! They have gluten free soy sauce for such occasions, you can choose western or traditional Japanese style. I should have specified he has a small appetite and doesn't eat much vegetables, but I was so grateful, I didn't want to make any requests. They just keep sending more food. They did not bring sauce out for the rice, so we brought our own soy sauce packet (I am sure she would have brought some out for him had we asked, but I was nervous to request anything else), and my son has a deep love for white rice with soy sauce. lol There was salad, roasted vegetables, soup, a tasty steak sliced looking pork, fruit, and a dessert. It all looked good, but I think he would have been just fine with the rice and pork and dessert. Oh and gluten free buns that he LOVED! He loved coming to the restaurant every day so he could eat their buns. \n\nYahata-san asked us when we expected to have breakfast the next day, and if she could prepare something for him. It was a hearty meal, again! More reminiscent of dinner, but quite tasty. There was some sauteed breakfast potatoes with veggies, tender salmon, and - gosh - I can't remember. A plate of fruit, and rice, and I think 2 bread rolls, because he was so excited about the bread. Maybe more. When we returned for dinner, the staff new us in advance. This time I kindly explained he eats only a little, and told them he loves the bread, rice, and meat. He had yakitori, rice, bread, and fruit. It was perfect! \n\nThe staff was so kind, so friendly! It was such a relief. We tried using the little Japanese we have learned, and I think that helps, too (not for explaining purposes, they had great grasp of English, but for showing we appreciate them and their culture). There are also many conbini in the area. I had picked up bananas and onigiri, but they weren't needed. \n\nSide note on what we did as a family with a 9 yr old, 7 yr old, and 5 yr old. Hananazono river rafting (very tame - safe for 3 and up, you get a dry suit, though my girls were a bit small for them so they leaked and were quite wet by the end, my 7 yr old was quite cold by the end as the water is about 17 degrees this time of year, but still super enjoyable), Hanazono evening gondola up to the midway point to walk down the jellyfish looking mountain lights (it's short, but neat. Gondola is completely enclosed!), and drove up to North Safari Sapporo to feed a bunch of animals for a quick half day trip. We didn't eat up there, just snacks in the car and drove back for a late (3pm!) lunch back at Indian that day. If my kids were a little bigger, we would have loved the tree trekking!",

My husband and I just got back from 2 weeks in Japan and got to enjoy some amazing food because of y’all. \n\nI’m celiac and nut free (I do eat coconut and can tolerate a little almond flour). Posting my favorite spots in each place we went.\n\nNot pictured:\nGluten Free T’s\nIt’s an absolute must — get the takoyaki and yakisoba! The takoyaki is incredible and was the only version I was able to find in Japan that was gluten free. The only reason I don’t have a pic is because we wolfed it down. \n\nBreakfast is not really a thing— most places don’t open before 11am. Recommend picking up some rice balls and coffee from 7/11! \n\nWe also did the omakase dinner with Kushiage Su in Tokyo and it was nice but I can’t say I’d go out of my way to go again. The spot is hard to find and is basically a studio apartment that’s been converted into an intimate counter-service style restaurant. \n\nLastly, have to give huge kudos to Ben Sojka for suggesting we take a day trip to Kinosaki. It’s a town with 7 onsens (hot springs) and is so beautiful and has the best gluten free dessert I had on the whole trip. We took the JR train using our rail pass. \n\nPS In terms of hotel/accommodation recommendations 10/10 would suggest Groove Hotel in Shinjuku, Tokyo. The location is perfect, comfiest bed I think I’ve ever slept in, and lots of gf options nearby (including the restaurant and gelato spot in the hotel itself). Also the ryokan (Ryokan Watanabe) we stayed at in Miyajima was unbelievably amazing. Such a cool experience and the meals were incredible and all gluten free.",

    "Title": "TLDR: does speaking Japanese make it easier to eat at non-GF places?\n\nHi everyone! My partner, daughter (3 years old) and I will be visiting Japan for 2 weeks in early November. I lived in Japan for 2 years and have visited several times. It's like my second home, and I speak Japanese (I'm not bilingual, but know enough to get by easily). However, since I was last in Japan I've been diagnosed with a wheat allergy (not coeliac), so I have never experienced Japan with an allergy.  \n\nI'm wondering, given I'm confident to communicate my allergy, will that make it easier? Or is the issue that Japanese restaurants just don't \"get it\" when it comes to wheat/gluten allergies? I've asked my Japanese friends, but as they don't have allergies themselves, they aren't sure what it will be like for me. Ideally I want to eat at \"normal\" places so that my partner and daughter don't miss out on all the usual food experiences (they have no allergies), rather than having to track down specific GF places.  Am I dreaming?\n\nAre there any people in this group in a similar situation (i.e able to communicate their allergies /requirements in Japanese) who could share their experience with eating wheat free/GF? We'll be mostly in Osaka and Tokyo, and we want to eat Japanese food rather than western food, if that makes any difference. I hope my question makes sense!",

        "Message": "Hi Sarah! I’m sensitive wheat intolerant (and I suspect also gluten in general) and speak Japanese at a conversational level. My experience is that while wheat is an allergen (making it easy to decipher labels), wheat allergy here is uncommon and usually (at least sometimes) something thought of as children’s allergies you grow out of. So some Japanese do not know what condiments there are wheat in. I have tried at different occasions that I’ve asked whether they used 小麦、and they say no, but still serve something with soy sauce, ponzu or the like, or with a pre-made dressing thickened w wheat. So just be careful and use common sense if they say ‘no wheat’ but still use sauces.",

        "Message": "Other folks with specifically wheat allergies will hopefully chime in, but for what it’s worth, in my experience a lot of the difficulty in explaining lies in the issue of hidden gluten, which is usually barley. Wheat is nearly always labeled, so you will find it easy to be accurately told whether or not a dish contains wheat. A lot of dishes though do contain wheat, whether as a thickener or in soy sauce. You’ll definitely have more options than someone needing GF. \n\nThat said - outside of specifically prepared allergy friendly meals, there will always be the risk of cross contamination. I am able to communicate just fine, but have been glutened in restaraunts by a stray breadcrumb, and by friends and family who just aren’t in the habit. Each person really does have to decide on their comfort with risk, and weigh the consequences for themselves - I get quite sick so I very rarely feel like it’s the worth the risk myself, but if it were a matter of just being uncomfortable for a day maybe I’d choose differently. Being able to communicate will help you reduce the risk and assess the risk but unless you stick to entirely wheat free places or places with allergy protocols you won’t be able to eliminate it.",

Today I saw a matcha truck at a shopping center. They had various matcha snacks and drinks. I only wanted a straight match ice drink (bascially, matcha/water.) So I asked if it was just matcha and water and she said yes, oh and sugar. Sugar? Why? But I could not get it without sugar so I realized it was some sort of blended powder. Not the real deal. Anyway, I walked away disappointed....",

We went for a birthday and they went over an above with free dishes, flowers to take home and polaroid photos as a reminder. This is one of the best meals and service we have had ever and I could not recommend enough. They were knowledgeable on coeliac and I felt totally safe and there was a lot on the menu that could be gluten free! You have to book well in advance but you will not regret it! Trust me.",

Cover, and simmer until the prom is cooked through. I’m pretty sure onions and ginger improve things, but I have a picky kid so we make the simple version. \n\nAlso on the menu this week, tomato chicken rice (no recipe, sauté onions and chicken, add a can tomato, some salt, the water you’d need for the rice and cook in the rice cooker or instant pot). \n\nChicken cream stew, onions and whatever veggies and chicken sautéed, cook in enough water to cover, add some salt, when it’s cooked through add roughly the same amount of milk/soy milk as you did water, and a few tablespoons of rice flour mixed with the milk, simmer gently until thickened. You can get fancy and do a proper white sauce roux and add that, but the cheaters version works too. Leftovers mix into either cooked rice or pasta and are topped with cheese for an easy microwaveable gratin the next day. \n\nSanshokudon - rice topped with scrambled eggs, greens, and mince meat cooked up with mirin and soy sauce (sauté the meat first, add the mirin if it starts to stick, save the soy sauce ‘til it’s nearly cooked so as not to scorch it)\n\nAlso on the menu is Thai curry - coconut milk and curry paste are at import and pro kitchen shops in my area",

We thought the lunch menu looked easier to navigate, but we made do of course! 🤣\nPhotos in comments.\n\n#Fukuoka #hakata #tempura #soba",
