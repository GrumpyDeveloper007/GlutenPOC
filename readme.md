# Gluten - POC project

I'm a coeliac, finding gluten free restaurants overseas requires a great research effort, lets make that easier (and create a POC MAUI app)

There is a great deal of information about places to eat out in various places online, forums, blogs etc
This information is generally not formatted well for the main question people have when travelling: 
I am here <insert street or city name>, what places are near by can I eat? Do they have a gluten free menu? Do they understand what gluten free means?

So the problem to be solved with this project is, how can I collect, format, sort information from these sources and present it in a geo spatial way, 
i.e. on google maps

Automate as much as possible the above process, provide information to fellow coeliacs and people who wish to eat gluten free
